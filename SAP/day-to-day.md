day to day activities

1. I manage 30+ pipelines on daily basics if there is any error(sonar covergae, vault roleid secred, invalid cred,  id I would fix it 
2. Manily we use Jenkins and GitHub as a orch
3. as there are 30+ services we use Grafana dashboard to check any failures 
4. there will be new pipeline request on which I need to work on if I'm assigned to it 
5. any new requirement in the particular ops and monitoring projects they would raise a JIRA and will work on that 
6. using shared lib we dynamically parameterise in config.yml file
7. if there is any compliance issues in pipeline will report dev and tell them to fix it
