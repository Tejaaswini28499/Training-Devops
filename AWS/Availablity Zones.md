## Availablility Zones

```
In AWS (Amazon Web Services), Availability Zones (AZs) are isolated 
locations within a region that are engineered to be independent from 
one another to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

Key Points About AWS Availability Zones:
Isolation: Each Availability Zone is physically separate from 
the others, with independent power, cooling, and networking.

Low Latency: Availability Zones within the same region are connected 
via high-speed, low-latency networks, allowing you to architect 
applications that automatically failover between zones without disruption.

Data Redundancy: You can replicate your data and distribute your resources 
across multiple AZs to protect your applications from data center failures.

High Availability: By using multiple Availability Zones, you can ensure that 
your applications and services remain operational even if one zone experiences 
an outage.
