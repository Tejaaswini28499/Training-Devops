1. consider e-commernce appln that will be accessible throughout the world its international appln requriment is it should be highly scalable robust and it should be highly available ypu are free to use all AWS resouces
2. why use monolathic over microservices
3. In case of observeability how would you monitor your entire ecosystem or entire appln
4. Secure appln and cloud infra what are the best measures you take- DDOS attack so we need to implement AWS Sheild can can also implement AWS FAF(expalin in detail)
5. customer is cost-sensitive as we are using lots of AWS services so what cost optimization measures you will take that doesnt affect
6. How would you connect on-premisis data to E-commerace appln which is in cloud using AWS -> VPC endpoints, VPC VPN side to side connectivitiy over Internet and private, direct connect(physical cables) connect on-prime to AWS very faster and more money and safer (lots of data better to have)
7. What is statefulset how it is different from Deployment
8. Multistage docker file
9. troublestooting - Cashloop backoff, Imagepullbackoff
10. what kind of logging used to monitor the pods
11. What is Gitops and Argo CD how it is different from traditional pipelines
12. Deployment Stategies
13. consider you have deployed the application ok EKS and it needs the access to S3 dynamodb how would you provide
14. If you have to develop an appln and deploy an appln across the k8 cluster how would you do -> helm
15. Consider multiaccount structure in an organasation there is already a setup but we need to create infrastruce and we have to deploy and appln in all these accounts what would be your ideal way to manage this entire ecosystem in terraform
16. what benefits you get when you create a custom modules in terrform and why do you create
17. have you ever worked on dynamic block if yes what is use of that and why is used
18. how would you create near perfect devsecops pipeline from init to deploy
