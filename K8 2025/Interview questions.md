## üåü **Kubernetes Interview Questions (5 Years Experience)**

### üß© **Core Concepts**

1. **What is a Pod in Kubernetes?**

   * Smallest deployable unit in K8s, one or more containers that share the same network namespace and storage.

2. **What‚Äôs the difference between ReplicaSet and Deployment?**

   * ReplicaSet ensures pod replicas; Deployment manages ReplicaSets (versioning, rollout, rollback).

3. **Explain the difference between StatefulSet and Deployment.**

   * StatefulSet maintains pod identity and stable storage (used for DBs).
   * Deployment is stateless (for web servers, APIs).

4. **What is the role of etcd in Kubernetes?**

   * Key-value store for all cluster state and configuration.

5. **What is the role of kube-scheduler?**

   * Decides on which node a pod should be scheduled based on resource requests, taints, affinity rules, etc.

6. **What is a Service in Kubernetes?**

   * An abstraction to expose pods as a network service.
     Types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName.

7. **Explain Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).**

   * PV: Actual storage provisioned in cluster.
   * PVC: Request for that storage by users/pods.

8. **Difference between ConfigMap and Secret.**

   * Both store configuration, but Secret is base64 encoded and used for sensitive data (passwords, tokens).

9. **Explain Namespaces in Kubernetes.**

   * Used to logically divide the cluster for isolation between teams or environments.

10. **Explain the Control Plane components.**

    * kube-apiserver, etcd, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, cloud-controller-manager.

how you devops decide pod size and worker node size as well as master node size
Excellent question üëç ‚Äî this is a **very common real-world + interview topic** in DevOps and Kubernetes architecture.

Let‚Äôs break it into parts so you understand **how we decide the size of pods, worker nodes, and master nodes**.

---

## üß© 1Ô∏è‚É£ POD SIZE (CPU + Memory)

Pods run your containers ‚Äî so **pod sizing** depends on your **application resource requirements**.

### üîπ How to decide pod size

You usually start by **profiling** or **testing the app**.

| Step                | What you do                                                            | Example                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Measure baseline | Run the app locally or in staging and measure CPU/memory usage at peak | e.g., Node.js API uses 200m CPU and 300Mi memory |
| 2. Add buffer       | Add 20‚Äì30% buffer for peak load                                        | Request: 250m CPU, 400Mi memory                  |
| 3. Define limits    | Define hard limits so it doesn‚Äôt consume everything                    | Limit: 500m CPU, 600Mi memory                    |

### ‚úÖ Example YAML

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "250m"
    memory: "400Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "600Mi"
```

### üß† Interview Tip

> ‚ÄúWe monitor the app resource usage using tools like Prometheus + Grafana, then tune pod requests and limits based on actual data, not assumptions.‚Äù

---

## üß© 2Ô∏è‚É£ WORKER NODE SIZE (Instance Type / VM size)

Worker nodes host the pods. Their size depends on:

### üîπ Key Factors

* **Total number of pods per node** (max is ~110 per node)
* **Aggregate resource requests** of all pods
* **Headroom for system daemons** (like kubelet, kube-proxy)
* **Cost vs Performance trade-off**

### üîπ Rule of thumb

* Keep **~70‚Äì80% utilization** per node.
* Choose node type that **matches pod mix** ‚Äî example:

| Use case            | Recommended Node Type    | Example                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Small microservices | 2‚Äì4 vCPU, 8‚Äì16 GB RAM    | `t3.large`, `m5.large`   |
| Medium workloads    | 8 vCPU, 32 GB RAM        | `m5.2xlarge`             |
| ML / Data heavy     | GPU or high-memory nodes | `p2.xlarge`, `r5.xlarge` |

### ‚úÖ Example Calculation

If each pod requests **0.5 CPU and 512Mi memory**,
and you want **20 pods per node**,
then you need at least:

* CPU = 0.5 √ó 20 = 10 vCPU
* Memory = 512Mi √ó 20 = 10Gi
  Choose an instance like `m5.2xlarge` (8 vCPU, 32 GiB RAM).

---

## üß© 3Ô∏è‚É£ MASTER NODE SIZE (Control Plane)

If you‚Äôre using **managed Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/AKS)** ‚Äî the control plane is managed by the cloud provider, and you don‚Äôt size it manually.

But for **self-managed clusters (e.g., kubeadm)**, sizing depends on:

* Cluster size (# of worker nodes, pods)
* Control plane workloads (etcd, API server, scheduler, controller-manager)

### üîπ Example sizing

| Cluster Size          | vCPU | RAM  | Notes                               |
| --------------------- | ---- | ---- | ----------------------------------- |
| Small (‚â§10 nodes)     | 2    | 4GB  | Single master ok                    |
| Medium (10‚Äì100 nodes) | 4    | 8GB  | HA masters (3) recommended          |
| Large (>100 nodes)    | 8    | 16GB | Dedicated etcd nodes sometimes used |

---

## üß≠ Real-World Strategy

In real DevOps teams, you rarely decide this by guesswork. The process looks like this:

1. **Start small** ‚Äî pick modest instance sizes.
2. **Deploy & monitor** ‚Äî use metrics from:

   * `kubectl top pods/nodes`
   * Prometheus/Grafana
   * CloudWatch (if AWS)
3. **Right-size iteratively** ‚Äî adjust resource requests, HPA targets, and node types.
4. **Use autoscaling**:

   * **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** for pods
   * **Cluster Autoscaler** for worker nodes

---

## üß† Example Interview Answer

> ‚ÄúWe size our pods based on profiling app resource usage during load testing, setting CPU/memory requests and limits accordingly.
> Worker node size is chosen to balance pod density and cost, usually targeting 70‚Äì80% utilization.
> For master nodes, in managed Kubernetes we rely on the provider, but in self-managed clusters we allocate 4‚Äì8 vCPUs and 8‚Äì16GB RAM depending on cluster size.
> Finally, we rely on monitoring and autoscaling to dynamically adjust resources.‚Äù

is it better to use just 2 big worker nodes or 5 smaller worker nodes
üî• Excellent question ‚Äî this one **really tests practical DevOps understanding** because there‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all answer.

Let‚Äôs break it down clearly üëá

---

## üß© Scenario: 2 big nodes vs 5 small nodes

| Option                      | Description                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| üß± **2 Big Worker Nodes**   | Fewer but more powerful VMs (e.g., 16 vCPU, 64GB each) |
| üß© **5 Small Worker Nodes** | More but smaller VMs (e.g., 4 vCPU, 16GB each)         |

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Comparison Table

| Criteria                           | 2 Big Nodes                                            | 5 Small Nodes                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **High Availability**              | ‚ùå Lower ‚Äî if 1 node fails, 50% capacity lost           | ‚úÖ Higher ‚Äî losing 1 node affects only ~20%          |
| **Scheduling Flexibility**         | ‚ùå Limited ‚Äî large pods may block resources             | ‚úÖ More balanced ‚Äî scheduler can spread load         |
| **Scalability**                    | ‚ùå Harder ‚Äî scaling a huge node type takes time         | ‚úÖ Easier ‚Äî smaller nodes can be added quickly       |
| **Cost Efficiency**                | ‚öñÔ∏è May be cheaper per vCPU but wasted if underutilized | ‚úÖ Better bin-packing, less idle capacity            |
| **Cluster Upgrades / Maintenance** | ‚ùå Risky ‚Äî draining 1 node evicts many pods             | ‚úÖ Safer ‚Äî drain affects fewer pods at a time        |
| **Network Overhead**               | ‚úÖ Lower (fewer nodes, fewer hops)                      | ‚öñÔ∏è Slightly higher, but negligible in modern setups |
| **Auto-scaling behavior**          | ‚öñÔ∏è Coarse-grained (scales in big chunks)               | ‚úÖ Fine-grained (adds/removes small nodes easily)    |

---

## üß† Real-World Rule of Thumb

> ‚úÖ **Prefer more smaller nodes** (like 4‚Äì8 vCPU range)
> unless you have a **very specific workload** (e.g., ML jobs or huge memory databases) that truly need large machines.

---

## üí° Example

Imagine you have 80 pods, each needing 1 vCPU and 1GB RAM.

### Option A: 2 Big Nodes (each 40 vCPU, 40GB)

* 1 node failure = 50% capacity gone
* During upgrades ‚Üí draining 40 pods = major churn
* Bad for HA

### Option B: 5 Small Nodes (each 16 vCPU, 16GB)

* 1 node failure = 20% capacity lost
* Upgrade impact small
* Scheduler can better distribute pods
  ‚úÖ More resilient and balanced.

---

## üöÄ DevOps Best Practice

* Use **smaller, uniform nodes** for most workloads.
* Add **node pools** for special cases:

  * high-memory apps ‚Üí `r5` family
  * GPU apps ‚Üí `p2` or `g5`
  * spot nodes for cost optimization.

---

## üß© Interview Answer Example

> ‚ÄúWe generally prefer more smaller worker nodes over a few large ones because it improves high availability, scheduling flexibility, and upgrade safety. Losing one small node affects fewer pods, and autoscaling becomes smoother. However, for workloads that require large CPU or memory, we maintain a separate node pool with larger instances.‚Äù

---

I have more traffice now 1x but in 15 days it will increase to 5x which type of autoscaling I need to go with when I have 1 master node and 4 worker nodes
üíØ Excellent ‚Äî this is a **very realistic DevOps scenario** and a **favorite interview question** because it tests how well you understand **autoscaling strategies in Kubernetes** (and the timing of scaling decisions).

Let‚Äôs break this down step-by-step üëá

---

## üß© Your Current Setup

* **Cluster**: 1 Master node (control plane)
* **Worker nodes**: 4
* **Current load**: 1√ó
* **Expected load (15 days)**: 5√ó

So ‚Äî in 2 weeks, your traffic will increase **5 times**. You need to prepare your cluster to **scale automatically** when that happens.

---

## üöÄ Autoscaling Types in Kubernetes

There are **three main types of autoscaling** you should know:

| Type                                | What It Scales         | Example                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)** | Number of pods         | Scales pods based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics |
| **VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler)**   | Resources inside pods  | Increases CPU/memory limits of a pod automatically  |
| **Cluster Autoscaler**              | Number of worker nodes | Adds/removes nodes when pods can‚Äôt be scheduled     |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Recommended Strategy for Your Case

Since your traffic will increase **gradually and predictably**, you should use a **combination of HPA + Cluster Autoscaler**.

---

### üß† Step-by-Step Plan

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**

To handle **spiky or growing app traffic**.

* Monitors CPU or custom metrics (like request rate).
* Increases number of pods automatically.

‚úÖ Example YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-app-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-app
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 20
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
```

üëâ When CPU usage >70%, new pods are added.

---

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Cluster Autoscaler**

To handle **node scaling** when pods can‚Äôt fit on existing nodes.

‚úÖ What it does:

* Checks if new pods are pending (unschedulable).
* Adds new worker nodes automatically.
* Removes idle nodes when not needed.

‚úÖ Works with cloud providers like AWS (EKS), GCP (GKE), Azure (AKS).

‚öôÔ∏è Example setup:

* Minimum nodes: 4
* Maximum nodes: 10
* Autoscaler will scale between 4‚Äì10 nodes based on pod demand.

---

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)**

Use this if your application‚Äôs resource usage **per pod changes** over time (e.g., ML or data-heavy jobs).

---

## üß© Architecture Flow

**1x traffic (current):**

* 4 worker nodes handle load
* Each deployment runs, say, 3 pods

**5x traffic (future):**

* HPA detects CPU ‚Üë ‚Üí adds pods
* Cluster Autoscaler detects pending pods ‚Üí adds worker nodes (up to 10)
* When load drops again ‚Üí pods reduce ‚Üí cluster shrinks automatically

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

| Point                | Explanation                                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Master Node**      | Keep master separate and stable. For production, use **3 control-plane nodes** for HA.                               |
| **Node Pool Design** | Have node groups per workload type (e.g., web, backend, batch).                                                      |
| **Monitoring**       | Use Prometheus + Grafana or CloudWatch to watch scale behavior.                                                      |
| **Pre-scaling**      | Since you *know* traffic will increase, you can increase minReplicas or minNodes ahead of time to avoid cold starts. |

---

## üß† Interview Answer Example

> ‚ÄúSince I expect 5√ó traffic in 15 days, I‚Äôd configure a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to scale my pods based on CPU or request rate.
> Along with that, I‚Äôd enable Cluster Autoscaler to add worker nodes when pods can‚Äôt be scheduled.
> This way, as traffic increases, pods scale horizontally and nodes scale vertically.
> I‚Äôd also monitor metrics and may pre-scale slightly before the expected traffic spike to avoid cold-start latency.‚Äù

‚ÄúSince I expect 5√ó traffic in 15 days, I‚Äôd configure a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to scale my pods based on CPU or request rate.
Along with that, I‚Äôd enable Cluster Autoscaler to add worker nodes when pods can‚Äôt be scheduled.
This way, as traffic increases, pods scale horizontally and nodes scale vertically.
I‚Äôd also monitor metrics and may pre-scale slightly before the expected traffic spike to avoid cold-start latency.‚Äù

why we need to increase the pods like why the replicas should be more ?? 

üíØ Awesome follow-up ‚Äî and it shows **you‚Äôre thinking like a real DevOps engineer**, not just memorizing answers üëè

Let‚Äôs go step by step to understand **why we increase replicas (pods)** when traffic grows.

---

## üß© First, Think of What a Pod Is

A **pod = one running instance of your application**.

If your app handles web traffic:

* 1 pod can handle **a certain number of requests per second (RPS)** before its **CPU or memory maxes out**.
* When traffic grows, that single pod will start getting **overloaded** ‚Üí high latency, errors, and timeouts.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example to Understand

Let‚Äôs say:

* 1 pod can handle **100 requests/second** comfortably.
* Currently, you get **80 RPS** ‚Üí fine ‚úÖ
* In 15 days, you expect **400 RPS** (5√ó more).

So‚Ä¶

```
400 RPS √∑ 100 RPS per pod = 4 pods needed
```

That‚Äôs why you need **more replicas** ‚Äî to spread the load evenly.

---

## üìä What Happens When You Don‚Äôt Scale Pods

| Situation     | Result                                                   |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Too few pods  | CPU/memory usage 100%, slow response, app crashes        |
| Balanced pods | Traffic distributed, low latency, smooth user experience |
| Too many pods | Wastes resources (but safer than crashing)               |

---

## üß† What HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) Does

* It monitors metrics like CPU usage, memory, or custom metrics (e.g., requests per second).
* When usage crosses a threshold (say >70%), it **creates new pods**.
* When load drops, it **removes extra pods** to save resources.

‚úÖ **So scaling pods = spreading load horizontally** across multiple instances.

---

## üí° Analogy (Easy to Remember)

Imagine a restaurant:

* 1 chef can handle 10 orders at once üç≥
* If 50 customers walk in suddenly, that 1 chef will burn out üòÖ
* Solution: Hire 4 more chefs so each handles 10 customers.

Pods = Chefs
Traffic = Customers
Scaling replicas = Hiring more chefs to keep service smooth.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è DevOps View

Increasing pods improves:

* **Load distribution** (via Service load balancing)
* **Fault tolerance** (if 1 pod dies, others handle traffic)
* **Zero-downtime upgrades** (rolling updates need extra pods)
* **High availability** (multiple pods across nodes/regions)

---

## ‚úÖ Interview-Ready Answer

> ‚ÄúWe increase pod replicas because each pod can handle only a limited amount of traffic.
> When load increases, multiple replicas share the incoming requests through the Service load balancer, preventing overload on a single pod.
> This ensures better performance, availability, and fault tolerance.
> The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler automatically adjusts replica count based on resource usage.‚Äù

if woker node is full and you are not able to allocate memerory in case of VPA what would you do
üî• Excellent ‚Äî this question shows **deep Kubernetes and DevOps understanding**, and it‚Äôs often asked in **advanced interviews**.

Let‚Äôs break it down clearly üëá

---

## üß© Situation

* You have **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)** enabled.
* Your **worker nodes are full** (no free CPU/memory).
* VPA tries to **increase pod memory or CPU**, but there‚Äôs **no room** left on the node.

---

## üß† What Happens Internally

Here‚Äôs what VPA tries to do:

1. It recommends a higher CPU/memory value for the pod (based on observed usage).
2. To apply that, it **needs to evict and recreate** the pod with new resource requests.
3. But‚Ä¶ if **no node has enough free space**, **the scheduler cannot place** that new pod.

Result ‚Üí The pod stays **Pending**, and scaling fails. üö´

## ‚úÖ What You (DevOps Engineer) Should Do

Here are **practical and real-world solutions**, from short-term fixes to long-term strategies üëá

---

### üîπ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Combine VPA with **Cluster Autoscaler**

This is the **best practice**.

* Cluster Autoscaler monitors for **unschedulable pods** (like the one VPA is trying to recreate).
* It automatically **adds a new worker node** to the cluster.
* Once the node joins, the pod can be rescheduled with increased resources.

‚úÖ **Ideal setup:**

* VPA ‚Üí adjusts pod resources
* Cluster Autoscaler ‚Üí adjusts node count

Together they form a **self-healing, self-scaling system**.

---

### üîπ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Manually Add Node Capacity (if autoscaler not enabled)

If you don‚Äôt have autoscaling:

* Manually **scale up** your worker node group (add more nodes).
* Or **increase instance size** (e.g., from `t3.medium` ‚Üí `t3.large`).
* Once new capacity is available, VPA can recreate pods successfully.

---

### üîπ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Tune Resource Requests and Limits

If VPA keeps hitting node limits, maybe:

* Your **requests/limits are too high**.
* Or your **cluster overcommitted resources** poorly.

Actions:

* Review VPA recommendations.
* Adjust resource limits manually.
* Use tools like:

  * `kubectl top pods`
  * `kubectl describe node`
  * Grafana dashboards
    to identify overused or underused pods.

---

### üîπ 4Ô∏è‚É£ Pre-scale Before Expected Load

Since you **know load is increasing (like your earlier 5√ó case)**, you can:

* Increase `minNodes` in Cluster Autoscaler
* Increase `minReplicas` in Deployment
* Ensure enough headroom for VPA to grow pods smoothly.

---

### üîπ 5Ô∏è‚É£ Check Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)

Sometimes, **PDBs prevent eviction**, which blocks VPA updates.
If VPA can‚Äôt evict pods ‚Üí it can‚Äôt apply new resource settings.

‚úÖ So verify your PDB allows at least **one pod** to be restarted for scaling.

---

## üß© Example Flow

Let‚Äôs say:

* Node: 4 vCPU, 8GiB memory
* Pod1 uses 2GiB ‚Üí VPA recommends 3GiB
* No node has 1GiB free ‚Üí Pod stuck Pending

‚û°Ô∏è Cluster Autoscaler sees unschedulable pod
‚û°Ô∏è Adds a new node
‚û°Ô∏è Pod recreated with 3GiB ‚Üí scheduled successfully ‚úÖ

## üß† Interview-Ready Answer

> ‚ÄúIf the worker node is full and VPA can‚Äôt allocate more memory, the pod will go into a Pending state because the scheduler can‚Äôt place it.
> In production, we always use VPA along with Cluster Autoscaler, so when pods become unschedulable, new nodes are automatically provisioned.
> If autoscaling isn‚Äôt enabled, I‚Äôd manually scale the node group or increase node instance size.
> I‚Äôd also verify Pod Disruption Budgets and check if resource limits are too strict, ensuring enough headroom for scaling.‚Äù
