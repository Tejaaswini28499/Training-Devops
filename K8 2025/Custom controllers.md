You want to understand **custom controllers in Kubernetes**. Let’s go step by step with clear explanations, use cases, and examples.

---

## 1. **What is a Kubernetes Controller?**

A **controller** in Kubernetes is a control loop that watches the state of your cluster and makes changes to move the current state toward the desired state.

* Examples of built-in controllers:

  * **Deployment Controller**: ensures the specified number of replicas of a pod are running.
  * **ReplicaSet Controller**: maintains a stable set of pod replicas.
  * **Job Controller**: ensures pods complete successfully.

---

## 2. **Why Custom Controllers?**

Sometimes, built-in controllers are not enough. For example, you might want to:

* Automatically create resources when a custom resource is created.
* Enforce custom business logic in your cluster.
* Extend Kubernetes to manage non-native resources.

In such cases, you build **Custom Controllers**.

---

## 3. **Components of a Custom Controller**

1. **Custom Resource Definition (CRD)**

   * Defines a new resource type (like `MyApp`) in Kubernetes.
   * Example:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
     kind: CustomResourceDefinition
     metadata:
       name: myapps.example.com
     spec:
       group: example.com
       versions:
         - name: v1
           served: true
           storage: true
           schema:
             openAPIV3Schema:
               type: object
               properties:
                 spec:
                   type: object
                   properties:
                     replicas:
                       type: integer
       scope: Namespaced
       names:
         plural: myapps
         singular: myapp
         kind: MyApp
         shortNames:
           - ma
     ```

2. **Controller Logic**

   * Watches for events on your CRD using **Informer** or **client-go**.
   * Reconciles desired vs. current state.
   * Creates, updates, or deletes Kubernetes resources based on CRD spec.

3. **Reconciliation Loop**

   * Core of controller logic: continuously checks the cluster state and applies changes.
   * Example: if `MyApp.spec.replicas = 3`, the controller ensures 3 pods exist.

## 4. **How Custom Controllers Work**

1. User creates a custom resource:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: example.com/v1
   kind: MyApp
   metadata:
     name: demo
   spec:
     replicas: 3
   ```
2. Controller detects creation of `MyApp` (using **watch/informer**).
3. Controller checks current state (e.g., no pods running).
4. Controller creates the necessary pods to match the desired state.
5. If user updates the `replicas` field, the controller adjusts the pods automatically.

---

## 5. **Implementation Options**

1. **client-go library** (Go) – native Kubernetes library.
2. **Kubebuilder** – scaffolding framework to generate controllers & CRDs.
3. **Operator SDK** – build more complex controllers called **Operators**.

---

## 6. **Simple Example of a Custom Controller**

* Suppose we have a CRD `MyApp`.
* Controller logic (simplified pseudocode):

```go
for event in watch(myapp):
    myapp = event.object
    desired_replicas = myapp.spec.replicas
    current_pods = list_pods(label="myapp="+myapp.name)
    
    if len(current_pods) < desired_replicas:
        create_pods(desired_replicas - len(current_pods))
    elif len(current_pods) > desired_replicas:
        delete_pods(len(current_pods) - desired_replicas)
```

---

## 7. **Use Cases of Custom Controllers**

* Managing database clusters (e.g., Postgres Operator).
* Auto-provisioning cloud resources (e.g., S3 buckets) from Kubernetes.
* Custom autoscaling logic beyond HPA.
* Enforcing policies or security configurations.

---

## 8. **Key Takeaways**

* **Controllers** maintain desired state.
* **Custom Controllers** let you extend Kubernetes for any resource or logic.
* **CRDs + Reconciliation Loop** = core of custom controllers.
* Tools like **Kubebuilder** and **Operator SDK** simplify the process.

If you want, I can make a **diagram showing how a custom controller works with CRDs and pods**—it helps visualize the flow clearly.

Do you want me to make that diagram?

Custom resource defenation

my understanding: OOTB there are few resources available in k8 if you need your own resource or extend the your API or you need to have custom resource like argo cd, Istio or others
you can extend the API or add new API to kuberenetes using this you can ask your customers to use required resources 
to extent we have 3 components 1. Custom Resource Defination 2. Custom Resource 3. Custom controller
1. Custom Resource Defination : K8 is saying you Istio or Argo cd to define new type of API to k8. 
how are you using??---> custom resource definition(CRD template) here you define in a yml file(like a template), it as all the options that they support and this you need to submit is custom resource(CR) 
2. custom resource - its a yml file users writes here and its validated with CRD
3. Custom controller - this controller should be deployed in K8 cluster controller will watch for the CR and acts accordingly - logic behind the controller - Watches for events on your CR using Informer or client-go. Reconciles desired vs. current state. Creates, updates, or deletes Kubernetes resources based on CRD spec.
