You want to understand **custom controllers in Kubernetes**. Let’s go step by step with clear explanations, use cases, and examples.

---

## 1. **What is a Kubernetes Controller?**

A **controller** in Kubernetes is a control loop that watches the state of your cluster and makes changes to move the current state toward the desired state.

* Examples of built-in controllers:

  * **Deployment Controller**: ensures the specified number of replicas of a pod are running.
  * **ReplicaSet Controller**: maintains a stable set of pod replicas.
  * **Job Controller**: ensures pods complete successfully.

---

## 2. **Why Custom Controllers?**

Sometimes, built-in controllers are not enough. For example, you might want to:

* Automatically create resources when a custom resource is created.
* Enforce custom business logic in your cluster.
* Extend Kubernetes to manage non-native resources.

In such cases, you build **Custom Controllers**.

---

## 3. **Components of a Custom Controller**

1. **Custom Resource Definition (CRD)**

   * Defines a new resource type (like `MyApp`) in Kubernetes.
   * Example:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
     kind: CustomResourceDefinition
     metadata:
       name: myapps.example.com
     spec:
       group: example.com
       versions:
         - name: v1
           served: true
           storage: true
           schema:
             openAPIV3Schema:
               type: object
               properties:
                 spec:
                   type: object
                   properties:
                     replicas:
                       type: integer
       scope: Namespaced
       names:
         plural: myapps
         singular: myapp
         kind: MyApp
         shortNames:
           - ma
     ```

2. **Controller Logic**

   * Watches for events on your CRD using **Informer** or **client-go**.
   * Reconciles desired vs. current state.
   * Creates, updates, or deletes Kubernetes resources based on CRD spec.

3. **Reconciliation Loop**

   * Core of controller logic: continuously checks the cluster state and applies changes.
   * Example: if `MyApp.spec.replicas = 3`, the controller ensures 3 pods exist.

## 4. **How Custom Controllers Work**

1. User creates a custom resource:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: example.com/v1
   kind: MyApp
   metadata:
     name: demo
   spec:
     replicas: 3
   ```
2. Controller detects creation of `MyApp` (using **watch/informer**).
3. Controller checks current state (e.g., no pods running).
4. Controller creates the necessary pods to match the desired state.
5. If user updates the `replicas` field, the controller adjusts the pods automatically.

---

## 5. **Implementation Options**

1. **client-go library** (Go) – native Kubernetes library.
2. **Kubebuilder** – scaffolding framework to generate controllers & CRDs.
3. **Operator SDK** – build more complex controllers called **Operators**.

---

## 6. **Simple Example of a Custom Controller**

* Suppose we have a CRD `MyApp`.
* Controller logic (simplified pseudocode):

```go
for event in watch(myapp):
    myapp = event.object
    desired_replicas = myapp.spec.replicas
    current_pods = list_pods(label="myapp="+myapp.name)
    
    if len(current_pods) < desired_replicas:
        create_pods(desired_replicas - len(current_pods))
    elif len(current_pods) > desired_replicas:
        delete_pods(len(current_pods) - desired_replicas)
```

---

## 7. **Use Cases of Custom Controllers**

* Managing database clusters (e.g., Postgres Operator).
* Auto-provisioning cloud resources (e.g., S3 buckets) from Kubernetes.
* Custom autoscaling logic beyond HPA.
* Enforcing policies or security configurations.

---

## 8. **Key Takeaways**

* **Controllers** maintain desired state.
* **Custom Controllers** let you extend Kubernetes for any resource or logic.
* **CRDs + Reconciliation Loop** = core of custom controllers.
* Tools like **Kubebuilder** and **Operator SDK** simplify the process.

If you want, I can make a **diagram showing how a custom controller works with CRDs and pods**—it helps visualize the flow clearly.

Do you want me to make that diagram?
