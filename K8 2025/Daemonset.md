what is Daemonset and why is this used if not daemon set how can we proceed

Good question üëç Let‚Äôs break it down clearly ‚Äî

---

### üß© **What is a DaemonSet in Kubernetes?**

A **DaemonSet** is a special kind of **Kubernetes controller** that ensures **a copy of a specific Pod runs on every (or selected) Node** in a cluster.

Think of it like this üëá

> ‚ÄúIf you have 10 nodes, and you want one monitoring/logging/agent pod on each node ‚Äî DaemonSet does it automatically.‚Äù

---

### üí° **Example Use Case**

DaemonSets are commonly used for system-level or background services that must run on **every node**:

| Use Case        | Example Pod                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Node monitoring | `node-exporter`, `Datadog-agent`, `Prometheus-node-exporter` |
| Log collection  | `fluentd`, `filebeat`                                        |
| Networking      | `kube-proxy`, `CNI plugins`                                  |
| Security agents | `Falco`, `Aqua Security`                                     |

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **DaemonSet Example YAML**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: node-logger
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: node-logger
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: node-logger
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: logger
        image: fluentd:latest
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "100m"
            memory: "200Mi"
```

‚úÖ **Result:**

* One `fluentd` pod runs **on each node** automatically.
* When a new node joins the cluster, **a new pod is created automatically** on it.

---

### üö´ **If Not DaemonSet ‚Äî What Then?**

If you **don‚Äôt** use a DaemonSet, and still want similar behavior, you‚Äôd have to:

#### Option 1: **Manually create pods per node**

* You‚Äôd create separate deployments or static pods for each node.
* ‚ùå Very hard to manage and scale ‚Äî especially when nodes join/leave.

#### Option 2: **Use a Deployment + Node Affinity**

* You can use `nodeAffinity` and replicas equal to number of nodes:

  ```yaml
  spec:
    replicas: 3
    affinity:
      nodeAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          nodeSelectorTerms:
          - matchExpressions:
            - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
              operator: In
              values: ["node1", "node2", "node3"]
  ```
* ‚ùå Still manual ‚Äî you must update YAML when new nodes are added.

‚úÖ **DaemonSet automatically handles this** ‚Äî that‚Äôs the reason it‚Äôs preferred for node-level pods.

### üîç **Summary**

| Feature                                | DaemonSet                       | Deployment    |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Runs one pod per node                  | ‚úÖ Yes                           | ‚ùå No          |
| Automatically adds pod when node joins | ‚úÖ Yes                           | ‚ùå No          |
| Good for background services           | ‚úÖ Yes                           | ‚ö†Ô∏è Not ideal  |
| Use cases                              | Monitoring, logging, networking | App workloads |

Would you like me to explain **how DaemonSets differ from Deployments and StatefulSets** (for interview-style understanding)?
