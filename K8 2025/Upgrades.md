while upgrading the versions from K8 1.2.8 to 1.30 what are the step you take
Upgrading Kubernetes from **1.28 to 1.30** (I assume 1.2.8 is a typo because 1.2.8 is extremely old) is a **major upgrade** that requires careful planning. Kubernetes upgrades should follow **minor version steps**, i.e., you **cannot jump multiple minor versions at once**, so you should upgrade sequentially: 1.28 → 1.29 → 1.30.

Here’s a structured step-by-step approach:

---

## **1. Plan the Upgrade**

1. **Check Kubernetes Version Skew Policy**

   * Master can be **up to 1 minor version ahead of nodes**.
   * So you can upgrade control plane first, then nodes.

2. **Read Release Notes**

   * Look at **deprecated APIs**, removed features, and behavioral changes.
   * Especially note **v1 APIs** that may be removed in 1.30.

3. **Inventory Current Cluster**

   * Nodes, workloads, CRDs, Ingress controllers, CSI drivers, network plugins.

4. **Backup Everything**

   * ETCD snapshot.
   * Cluster state (deployments, configmaps, secrets).
   * Persistent volumes (PV/PVCs).

---

## **2. Upgrade the Control Plane**

1. **Upgrade kubeadm on the control plane nodes**

   ```bash
   apt-get update && apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.30.x-00
   ```

2. **Plan the upgrade**

   ```bash
   kubeadm upgrade plan
   ```

   * Shows what versions are available and whether the upgrade is safe.

3. **Upgrade the control plane**

   ```bash
   kubeadm upgrade apply v1.30.x
   ```

4. **Upgrade kubelet and kubectl on control plane nodes**

   ```bash
   apt-get install -y kubelet=1.30.x-00 kubectl=1.30.x-00
   systemctl daemon-reload
   systemctl restart kubelet
   ```

---

## **3. Upgrade Worker Nodes**

1. **Drain the node**

   ```bash
   kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-local-data
   ```

2. **Upgrade kubeadm on the node**

   ```bash
   apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.30.x-00
   ```

3. **Upgrade the node**

   ```bash
   kubeadm upgrade node
   ```

4. **Upgrade kubelet and kubectl**

   ```bash
   apt-get install -y kubelet=1.30.x-00 kubectl=1.30.x-00
   systemctl daemon-reload
   systemctl restart kubelet
   ```

5. **Uncordon the node**

   ```bash
   kubectl uncordon <node-name>
   ```

6. **Repeat for all worker nodes**

---

## **4. Upgrade Addons and Components**

* **CNI plugins** (Calico, Flannel, etc.)
* **CoreDNS**
* **Ingress controllers**
* **CSI drivers / Storage drivers**
* **Metrics server / dashboard**

Check their compatible versions with 1.30.

---

## **5. Validate Cluster**

* Verify **all nodes are Ready**:

  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```
* Verify workloads:

  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -A
  ```
* Test **applications**.
* Check **deprecated API usage**:

  ```bash
  kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces -o yaml | grep apiVersion
  ```

---

## **6. Post-Upgrade Tasks**

* Remove deprecated APIs or features.
* Update manifests to new APIs.
* Monitor logs and cluster health for at least a few hours/days.

---

### ⚠️ **Important Notes**

* Upgrade **sequentially**: 1.28 → 1.29 → 1.30.
* Always **backup etcd** before upgrading.
* Check **cloud provider or managed Kubernetes docs** if using EKS/GKE/AKS.
* Test the upgrade in **staging** first, not directly in production.

If you want, I can make a **visual stepwise diagram** showing **control plane → worker nodes → addons** upgrade for 1.28 → 1.30. It makes this process much easier to follow.

Do you want me to do that?

even if we are using AWS EKS should be still perform all of this
Ah! If you are using **AWS EKS**, the upgrade process is **simplified**, but some steps still apply. You **do not need to manually upgrade kubeadm or kubelet**, because AWS manages the control plane for you. Here's how it changes:

---

## **1. Control Plane Upgrade**

* **EKS manages the control plane**, so AWS handles:

  * API server
  * etcd
  * Controller manager
  * Scheduler
* **You just trigger the version upgrade** via:

  * **AWS Console** → EKS → Cluster → Update cluster version
  * **AWS CLI**:

    ```bash
    aws eks update-cluster-version --name <cluster_name> --kubernetes-version 1.30
    ```
* AWS ensures the control plane is upgraded **without downtime**.

---

## **2. Worker Nodes Upgrade**

* If using **managed node groups**:

  * Upgrade nodes via AWS console or CLI.
  * AWS provisions new nodes with the target Kubernetes version.
  * Old nodes are drained and terminated automatically (rolling upgrade).
* Commands (CLI):

  ```bash
  aws eks update-nodegroup-version \
      --cluster-name <cluster_name> \
      --nodegroup-name <nodegroup_name> \
      --kubernetes-version 1.30
  ```
* If using **self-managed nodes**:

  * You **still need to upgrade kubelet and kubectl** manually on each node.
  * Drain nodes, upgrade packages, then uncordon.

---

## **3. Addons**

Even in EKS, you need to check **addon compatibility**:

* **CoreDNS**
* **kube-proxy**
* **VPC CNI**
* **Ingress controllers / CSI drivers**
* Upgrade them via:

  ```bash
  aws eks update-addon --cluster-name <cluster_name> --addon-name <addon> --addon-version <version>
  ```

---

## **4. Validate Cluster**

* Check nodes and workloads:

  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  kubectl get pods -A
  ```
* Test applications.
* Make sure no deprecated APIs are breaking workloads.

✅ **Key Difference in EKS vs Self-Managed**

| Step                  | Self-Managed K8s           | EKS Managed                                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Control Plane Upgrade | Manual (`kubeadm upgrade`) | AWS handles it                                               |
| Worker Nodes Upgrade  | Manual (`kubelet/kubeadm`) | Managed node groups auto-upgrade / self-managed nodes manual |
| Addons Upgrade        | Manual                     | AWS CLI/console                                              |
| Backup etcd           | You must do it             | AWS manages control plane etcd                               |

---

So basically, **with EKS you mostly trigger upgrades and focus on worker nodes and addons**, not the control plane itself.

If you want, I can make a **step-by-step EKS-specific upgrade checklist** for 1.28 → 1.30 to make it foolproof.

Do you want me to make that?
