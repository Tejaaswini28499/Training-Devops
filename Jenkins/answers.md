Jenkins - 
configure systems - is where you will configure other server url 
global configuration we configure the JAVA jdk version , Maven, Ant , sonar tools configuration will be done here
plugins - want to use any tech we need to install those plugins
Node is like a machine on which you execute our code, if you want new node you can configure that also


What is Jenkins
Jenkins is an open-source automation server used mainly for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD).

In simple words — Jenkins helps automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications so developers don’t have to do these steps manually every time code changes.

| Stage                           | Description                                                           | Example                               |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Continuous Integration (CI)** | Automatically build and test code whenever developers push changes    | Jenkins builds a Java app using Maven |
| **Continuous Delivery (CD)**    | Automatically prepare and deploy tested code to staging or production | Jenkins deploys to Kubernetes cluster |

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean compile -DskipTests=true'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml'
            }
        }
    }
}



diff btw continous delivery and continous deployment 
Great question 👏 — this is one of the most common interview topics in DevOps!

Let’s break it down clearly 👇

---

### 🔹 **Continuous Delivery (CD)**

**Goal:**
Automatically build, test, and prepare code for release — but **deployment to production is a manual decision**.

✅ Code is always **ready to deploy**,
❌ But an engineer or manager **approves and triggers** the deployment.

**Example:**

* Jenkins automatically builds and tests your app.
* It deploys the latest version to a **staging environment**.
* A release manager reviews it and **clicks “Deploy to Production”** manually.

**So:**

> In Continuous Delivery → The code is ready for production anytime, but the release is **manual**.

---

### 🔹 **Continuous Deployment**

**Goal:**
Automatically build, test, and **deploy code to production** — with **no manual approval** needed.

✅ Every change that passes tests automatically goes live.

**Example:**

* A developer pushes code → Jenkins builds → tests pass → app is automatically deployed to production.

**So:**

> In Continuous Deployment → The release to production is **fully automated**.

---

### 🔹 Comparison Table

| Feature                   | Continuous Delivery                | Continuous Deployment                            |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Automation Level**      | Build, test, staging automated     | Build, test, **and production deploy** automated |
| **Production Deployment** | Manual approval required           | Fully automatic                                  |
| **Risk**                  | Lower (human review before deploy) | Higher (needs strong test automation)            |
| **Speed**                 | Slightly slower                    | Fastest — every commit can go live               |
| **Example Tools**         | Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Argo CD   | Jenkins, Spinnaker, Argo CD, FluxCD              |

---

### 🔹 Simple Analogy

Imagine a **restaurant kitchen** 🍳

* **Continuous Delivery:** The chef prepares the dish and keeps it ready — waiter decides when to serve.
* **Continuous Deployment:** As soon as the dish is ready, it’s automatically served to the customer — no waiter approval.

What are the advantages of using Jenkins?
“Jenkins automates CI/CD, integrates easily with many tools, supports distributed builds, and is open-source with strong community support — helping deliver code faster and more reliably.”

what are the types of Jenkins pipeline
Excellent question 👏 — this one is **frequently asked in Jenkins/DevOps interviews**!

Let’s go step by step 👇

---

## 🔹 **Types of Jenkins Pipelines**

Jenkins supports **three main types** of pipelines:

| Type                                         | Description                                                                                                  | Defined Using                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Declarative Pipeline**                  | A simpler and more structured syntax. It uses predefined blocks like `pipeline`, `agent`, `stages`, `steps`. | `Jenkinsfile` (Groovy syntax but easier to read) |
| **2. Scripted Pipeline**                     | More powerful and flexible; written entirely in Groovy code. Used when you need complex logic.               | `Jenkinsfile` (pure Groovy script)               |
| **3. Declarative + Scripted Mixed Pipeline** | Combines both styles — mostly declarative with small scripted sections where extra control is needed.        | `Jenkinsfile`                                    |

---

### 🔸 1️⃣ **Declarative Pipeline (Most Common)**

**Example:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean compile -DskipTests=true'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

✅ **Features:**

* Simple syntax (easy to read/write)
* Built-in error handling (`post` block for success/failure)
* Best for most CI/CD pipelines

---

### 🔸 2️⃣ **Scripted Pipeline**

**Example:**

```groovy
node {
    stage('Build') {
        sh 'mvn clean compile -DskipTests=true'
    }
    stage('Test') {
        sh 'mvn test'
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
        sh 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml'
    }
}
```

✅ **Features:**

* Fully written in Groovy — more flexible and programmable
* Suitable for complex logic (loops, conditions, shared libraries)
* Harder to read but powerful

---

### 🔸 3️⃣ **Declarative + Scripted Mixed**

**Example:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Scripted block inside Declarative
                    def version = sh(script: "git rev-parse --short HEAD", returnStdout: true).trim()
                    echo "Building version ${version}"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

✅ **Features:**

* Declarative for readability
* Scripted for flexibility when needed

---

### 🔸 Bonus (Conceptual Types)

Sometimes people also mention **other types** based on usage:

| Concept                     | Meaning                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multibranch Pipeline**    | Automatically creates pipelines for each Git branch.                       |
| **Pipeline as Code**        | Pipeline defined in a `Jenkinsfile` inside source control (best practice). |
| **Shared Library Pipeline** | Reusable pipeline logic shared across multiple projects.                   |

---

### 💡 Interview Tip:

If the interviewer asks:

> “What type of pipeline do you use?”

You can say:

> “We mainly use **Declarative Pipelines** defined in `.pipeline/config.yml` or `Jenkinsfile`.
> They’re cleaner, easier to maintain, and integrate well with SAP Project Piper for automated CI/CD.”

---
What is a Jenkinsfile? Why is it important?
A Jenkinsfile tells Jenkins what to do when new code is pushed — step by step.
“A Jenkinsfile defines the CI/CD pipeline as code.
It ensures version control, consistency, and automation — making pipelines easy to reproduce, review, and modify.”

what are plugins in Jenkins and why its important
Perfect 👏 — Jenkins plugins are **a very common interview topic**. Let’s break it down clearly.

---

## 🔹 **What are Jenkins Plugins?**

**Plugins** in Jenkins are **add-ons or extensions** that enhance Jenkins’ functionality.

> They allow Jenkins to integrate with other tools, add new features, or customize workflows.

Without plugins, Jenkins is a **barebones automation server**, and you can’t connect it to version control, build tools, testing tools, or deployment platforms.

---

### 🔹 **Why Plugins are Important**

* Integrate Jenkins with **Git, GitHub, Bitbucket, SVN**.
* Connect to **build tools** like Maven, Gradle, npm.
* Add **notifications** via Slack, email, MS Teams.
* Enable **deployment** to Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, etc.
* Extend functionality (e.g., monitoring, reporting, pipelines).

In short: **Plugins make Jenkins a powerful CI/CD orchestration tool.** ✅

---

### 🔹 **Commonly Used Jenkins Plugins**

| Plugin Name                     | Purpose                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Git Plugin**                  | Connect Jenkins to Git repositories.             |
| **GitHub Branch Source Plugin** | For multibranch pipelines with GitHub.           |
| **Pipeline Plugin**             | Enables Jenkins Pipeline functionality.          |
| **Maven Integration Plugin**    | Run Maven builds easily.                         |
| **Docker Plugin**               | Build and manage Docker containers.              |
| **Kubernetes Plugin**           | Deploy builds to Kubernetes clusters.            |
| **Slack Notification Plugin**   | Send build status notifications to Slack.        |
| **Email Extension Plugin**      | Send custom email alerts for builds.             |
| **JUnit Plugin**                | Publish test results and reports.                |
| **Credentials Plugin**          | Manage secrets like passwords, tokens, SSH keys. |
| **Blue Ocean Plugin**           | Modern UI for Jenkins pipelines visualization.   |

---

### 🔹 **Interview Tip**

If asked *“Why plugins?”* → you can say:

> “Plugins extend Jenkins’ capabilities, allowing it to integrate with tools for version control, build, test, deployment, notifications, and reporting, making it highly flexible for CI/CD pipelines.”

What is the use of mvn clean install or mvn clean compile in Jenkins?
| Command                              | What it does                                                                     | Use in Jenkins                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `mvn clean compile`                  | Deletes old build + compiles code                                                | Check for compilation errors                        |
| `mvn clean install`                  | Deletes old build + compiles + runs tests + packages + installs artifact locally | Full build for testing or deployment                |
| `mvn clean install -DskipTests=true` | Full build but **skips tests**                                                   | Fast build in early stages or non-prod environments |


can we use both clean and install together??

“We can use mvn clean compile first to quickly catch compilation errors, then mvn clean install to build, test, and package the artifact. This approach gives faster feedback in CI/CD pipelines.”

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Compile') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean compile'
            }
        }
        stage('Build & Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
    }
}



what are /target folder 
Perfect — this is a common Maven/Jenkins question. Let’s break it down clearly 👇

---

## 🔹 **What is the `/target` folder?**

In a **Maven project**, the `/target` folder is the **default directory where Maven stores all the build outputs**.

It is **automatically created** when you run Maven commands like `mvn compile`, `mvn package`, or `mvn install`.

---

### 🔹 **What goes inside `/target`?**

| Item                      | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compiled classes**      | `.class` files generated from your `.java` source files (from `src/main/java`). |
| **Packaged artifacts**    | JAR, WAR, or EAR files created by Maven during `mvn package` or `mvn install`.  |
| **Test reports**          | Results of unit tests (e.g., from `mvn test`).                                  |
| **Temporary build files** | Anything Maven needs during the build, like generated sources.                  |

---

### 🔹 **Example**

If your project is named `MyApp`:

```bash
MyApp/
 ├── src/
 │    ├── main/
 │    └── test/
 └── target/
       ├── classes/          # compiled .class files
       ├── test-classes/     # compiled test classes
       ├── MyApp-1.0.jar     # packaged artifact
       └── surefire-reports/ # test results
```

---

### 🔹 **Relation with Jenkins**

* When Jenkins runs `mvn clean compile` → `/target` is **created with compiled classes**.
* When Jenkins runs `mvn clean install` → `/target` contains **compiled classes + packaged artifact + test reports**.
* Usually, Jenkins **archives the artifacts from `/target`** for deployment or further stages.

---

### 🔹 **Why `mvn clean` deletes `/target`**

* `clean` ensures that **old artifacts don’t interfere** with the new build.
* It deletes `/target` before a fresh build.

---

💡 **Interview Tip:**

> “In a Maven project, `/target` is where all compiled classes, packaged artifacts, and test reports are stored. Jenkins uses it to get the build outputs and artifacts for deployment.”

---

## 🔹 **Jenkins Master-Slave Architecture** (now called **Controller-Agent**)

Jenkins uses a **distributed architecture** to **run builds efficiently**.

* **Master (Controller)** → Manages Jenkins.
* **Slave (Agent)** → Executes the jobs/builds assigned by the Master.

---

### 🔸 **1️⃣ Jenkins Master (Controller)**

**Responsibilities:**

* Hosts the **Jenkins web UI**.
* Stores **configuration, job definitions, plugins, and build history**.
* Schedules and **assigns jobs to agents**.
* Monitors build progress and reports results.

**Analogy:** Master = **Traffic Manager** 🚦

---

### 🔸 **2️⃣ Jenkins Slave (Agent)**

**Responsibilities:**

* Receives jobs from Master.
* Executes the **build, test, and deployment steps**.
* Sends build results and logs back to the Master.

**Features:**

* Can run on **different OS** (Linux, Windows, macOS).
* Can be **ephemeral** (spin up in cloud/docker for temporary jobs).
* Multiple agents can run in parallel → **faster builds**.

**Analogy:** Slave = **Worker** 👷

---

### 🔹 **Why this architecture is used**

1. **Distributed Builds:** Multiple jobs can run simultaneously on different agents.
2. **Scalability:** Add more agents as project size or team grows.
3. **OS Flexibility:** Agents can run on different OS or environments.
4. **Resource Optimization:** Heavy builds can run on powerful machines without affecting Master.

---

### 🔹 **Diagram**

```
           +--------------------+
           |    Jenkins Master   |
           | (Controller)       |
           | - UI               |
           | - Job scheduling   |
           | - Config/Plugins   |
           +----------+---------+
                      |
      +---------------+-----------------+
      |               |                 |
+-------------+  +-------------+  +-------------+
| Jenkins Agent|  | Jenkins Agent|  | Jenkins Agent|
|   (Linux)   |  |   (Windows)  |  |  (Docker)    |
+-------------+  +-------------+  +-------------+
```

---

### 🔹 **How Jobs Flow**

1. Developer pushes code → Master detects change.
2. Master decides which **agent** to run the job on.
3. Agent executes **build/test/deploy** steps.
4. Agent sends **results/logs** back to Master.
5. Master updates UI and notifies stakeholders.

---

### 🔹 **Interview Tip**

If asked *“Difference between Master-Slave and Controller-Agent?”* → you can say:

> “Controller-Agent is the modern terminology of Master-Slave. The Controller manages Jenkins, schedules jobs, and handles configuration. Agents execute jobs and send results back. This architecture allows **distributed, scalable, and parallel builds**.”

---

What is a “post” block in a declarative pipeline?
“A post block in a declarative pipeline defines actions that run after a stage or pipeline completes, such as sending notifications, cleaning up, or archiving artifacts.
It helps ensure important tasks run regardless of build success or failure.”

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            echo 'This runs always, regardless of success or failure'
        }
        success {
            echo 'This runs only if the pipeline succeeds'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'This runs only if the pipeline fails'
        }
        unstable {
            echo 'This runs if the pipeline is unstable (e.g., test failures)'
        }
        changed {
            echo 'This runs if the build status has changed compared to the previous build'
        }
    }
}

How do you use environment variables in Jenkins pipelines?

What is the use of the stash and unstash steps in pipelines?

What are Jenkins Shared Libraries?

Common Groovy scripts reused across pipelines.

How do you handle parallel execution in Jenkins?


------------------------------------------------------------------------
















What is Jenkins Job?
A Job in Jenkins = an automated process (build, test, deploy) that Jenkins executes.

Every job has its own configuration (steps, triggers, environment, etc.).

Jobs can be triggered manually, automatically (on commit/push), or periodically (cron).

A Jenkins job can be defined using:

The Jenkins UI (Freestyle job), or

A Pipeline as Code (Jenkinsfile or config.yml).


What is post Actions groovy is there any actions in your project
Excellent — this is a **Groovy post-extension script** used in Jenkins (specifically with **SAP Project “Piper”** pipelines).

Let’s break it down **line by line** so you can explain exactly what it does 👇

---

## 🔹 **Context**

This script is a **post-action extension** — it runs **after a pipeline stage** (kind of like a “hook”).
It’s typically placed in `.pipeline/extensions/` or a shared library and is automatically loaded by the Piper framework.

Its main purpose is to:
✅ Run some **custom logic (pipeline_dashboard_pscdp)** after a stage finishes
✅ Ensure it only runs **once per pipeline**
✅ Then **call back** the original pipeline stage logic

---

## 🔹 **Line-by-Line Explanation**

### ```groovy

import com.sap.piper.JenkinsUtils
import jenkins.model.*;
import org.jenkinsci.plugins.scriptsecurity.scripts.*;
import org.jenkinsci.plugins.scriptsecurity.sandbox.whitelists.*;
import static com.sap.piper.Prerequisites.checkScript

````
📘 **Imports**
- These are Piper and Jenkins classes used for pipeline scripting and sandbox handling.  
- `checkScript` ensures that the provided script is valid and trusted.

---

### ```groovy
library identifier: 'pscdp_dashboard_enhancement@main', retriever: modernSCM(
        [$class       : 'GitSCMSource',
         remote       : 'https://github.tools.sap/PS-CDAutomation/CDP_DATA_COLLECTOR_JENKINS.git',
         credentialsId: 'githubapitoken_dashboardauto-tools-serviceuser'])
````

📘 **Loads an external shared library** dynamically.

* `pscdp_dashboard_enhancement@main` → the library name and branch.
* It’s retrieved from the **SAP internal GitHub Enterprise repo** using the given credentials.
* This library probably contains reusable functions (for reporting or dashboard updates).

---

### ```groovy

void call(Map params) {

````
📘 **Entry point function** — Jenkins executes this automatically when the post-extension runs.  
The `params` map contains:
- `script` → pipeline script context  
- `originalStage` → the original stage logic that was supposed to run  

---

### ```groovy
if (!params.script.commonPipelineEnvironment.getValue('postExtensionExecuted')) {
    params.script.commonPipelineEnvironment.setValue('postExtensionExecuted', true)
    pipeline_dashboard_pscdp script: this
}
````

📘 **Key Logic**

1. Checks if a flag `postExtensionExecuted` is **already set**.

   * This ensures the extension runs **only once per pipeline** (avoiding duplicates).
2. If not set:

   * Marks it as `true`.
   * Calls another custom function `pipeline_dashboard_pscdp`, passing the current script.
     ➜ This likely **updates a dashboard or metrics collector** with pipeline data.

So basically:

> "If this post action hasn’t run yet, mark it as executed and trigger dashboard update logic."

---

### ```groovy

params.originalStage()

````
📘 **Executes the actual pipeline stage** that this post-extension wraps.  
It ensures the **original functionality still runs** after your extension logic.

---

### ```groovy
return this
````

📘 Returns the current script context — standard Groovy practice for shared library scripts.

---

## 🔹 **In Simple Terms**

> This Groovy post-extension ensures that after each stage (or pipeline), a custom SAP dashboard update (`pipeline_dashboard_pscdp`) runs **once per pipeline**.
> It loads a shared library for dashboard logic, sets a flag to avoid duplication, and then runs the original stage.

---

## 🔹 **How to Explain in an Interview**

> “This is a post-extension script in SAP Piper. It runs after the main pipeline stage, loads a shared library from GitHub, updates a custom dashboard via `pipeline_dashboard_pscdp`, and ensures it only runs once by using the `commonPipelineEnvironment` flag `postExtensionExecuted`. Finally, it calls the original stage logic to continue normal execution.”

---

what is stash and unstash in Jenkins 
Excellent question 👏 — this is an important Jenkins pipeline concept, especially in multi-stage or multi-agent pipelines.

Let’s break it down clearly 👇

---

## 🔹 **What Are `stash` and `unstash` in Jenkins?**

In Jenkins pipelines, **`stash`** and **`unstash`** are used to **transfer files between different stages or agents**.

When your pipeline runs across **multiple nodes/agents** (for example, build on one machine and test on another), you often need to pass files like:

* Compiled binaries
* Test reports
* Configuration files

Instead of re-checking out the repo or rebuilding everything, you can **stash** those files after one stage and **unstash** them in another.

---

## 🔹 **How They Work**

### **`stash`**

* Saves a set of files (from the workspace) in a temporary storage area inside Jenkins master.
* You can give it a unique name.

```groovy
stash name: 'build-artifacts', includes: 'target/**/*'
```

This means:

> “Save all files inside `target/` as a stash called `build-artifacts`.”

---

### **`unstash`**

* Restores those saved files into the current workspace on another node/stage.

```groovy
unstash 'build-artifacts'
```

This means:

> “Retrieve the files that were stashed earlier with that name.”

---

## 🔹 **Typical Use Case Example**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent none
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            agent { label 'build-node' }
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean package'
                stash name: 'jar', includes: 'target/*.jar'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            agent { label 'test-node' }
            steps {
                unstash 'jar'
                sh 'java -jar target/myapp.jar --test'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

🟢 **What’s happening:**

1. The **Build** stage compiles code on a “build node.”
2. It stashes the generated `.jar` file.
3. The **Test** stage runs on a “test node,” retrieves the `.jar` via `unstash`, and runs tests.

---

## 🔹 **Why It’s Important**

✅ Allows **data sharing between stages**
✅ Supports **multi-agent or parallel builds**
✅ Avoids re-checkout or rebuild
✅ Keeps pipelines **modular and faster**

---

## 🔹 **Limitations**

⚠️ Stashes are:

* **Stored temporarily** (deleted after pipeline ends)
* **Not meant for large files**
* **Not shared across different pipelines**

For long-term or large artifacts, use:
👉 Jenkins **archiveArtifacts** or a dedicated **artifact repository** (like Nexus, Artifactory, or S3).

---

## 🔹 **Interview-Ready Answer**

> “`stash` and `unstash` are used in Jenkins pipelines to transfer files between stages or agents.
> For example, after building code on one node, we can `stash` the build artifacts and later `unstash` them on another node for testing or deployment.
> They are temporary storage mechanisms that help make multi-stage pipelines efficient and modular.”

What are Jenkins Shared Libraries?
Excellent — this is one of the most important Jenkins interview questions, especially for DevOps roles using **SAP Project Piper** or **enterprise Jenkins setups** 💪

Let’s go step by step 👇

---

## 🔹 **What are Jenkins Shared Libraries?**

A **Jenkins Shared Library** is a way to **reuse and centralize pipeline code** across multiple Jenkins pipelines.

Instead of repeating the same Groovy steps in every `Jenkinsfile`, you can move that logic into a **shared Git repository** and import it into any pipeline.

---

## 🔹 **Why It’s Needed**

Without shared libraries:

* Each project would have its own complex `Jenkinsfile`.
* Any small logic change (e.g., new build step) must be updated in multiple files.
* Harder to maintain, debug, and ensure consistency.

With shared libraries:
✅ You write pipeline code once
✅ Reuse it across projects
✅ Keep Jenkinsfiles simple and clean

---

## 🔹 **How It Works**

Jenkins Shared Libraries are stored in **a Git repository** (like GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, or internal repo).
They are then **loaded dynamically** in the `Jenkinsfile`.

---

### **Structure of a Shared Library Repo**

```
(vars/)
    buildApp.groovy
    deployApp.groovy
(src/)
    org/company/utils/Helper.groovy
(resources/)
    templates/config.yml
```

🗂 Explanation:

* `vars/` → contains reusable pipeline steps (called **global vars**).
  Each `.groovy` file inside this acts like a global function.
* `src/` → contains Groovy classes and helper functions (like Java package style).
* `resources/` → holds static files (like YAML templates or configs).

---

## 🔹 **How to Use It in a Jenkinsfile**

You load it at the top of your pipeline:

```groovy
@Library('my-shared-library') _
```

Then you can call any shared function:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                buildApp()   // function from vars/buildApp.groovy
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

## 🔹 **Example of a Shared Library Function**

`vars/buildApp.groovy`

```groovy
def call() {
    echo "Building the application..."
    sh 'mvn clean package -DskipTests=true'
}
```

Now any Jenkinsfile can simply call `buildApp()` instead of repeating those steps.

---

## 🔹 **Advantages**

✅ **Reusability** – Write once, use in all pipelines
✅ **Maintainability** – Update logic in one place
✅ **Consistency** – Same process for all teams/projects
✅ **Scalability** – Works great in large Jenkins installations (like SAP’s CI/CD with Piper)
✅ **Versioning** – You can specify which version/branch of library to use

Example:

```groovy
@Library('my-shared-library@v2.1') _
```

---

## 🔹 **In SAP Project “Piper”**

SAP’s Piper pipeline heavily relies on **shared libraries**.
The entire Piper framework is implemented as a **Jenkins shared library** that provides standard stages like:

* `piperExecuteStage`
* `piperPipeline`
* `piperInit`
* and extensions like your post hook (`post.groovy`)

That’s why you often see:

```groovy
library identifier: 'piper-lib-os@master', retriever: modernSCM(...)
```

---

## 🔹 **Interview-Ready Answer**

> “Jenkins Shared Libraries allow you to centralize and reuse pipeline code across multiple Jenkinsfiles.
> Instead of writing repetitive Groovy steps in every pipeline, we define reusable functions in a shared Git repository and import it using `@Library()`.
> It improves maintainability, consistency, and scalability — for example, SAP’s Project Piper itself is implemented as a shared library.”

---

How do you handle long-running builds efficiently in Jenkins?
Excellent — this is a **very practical and common Jenkins interview question**, especially for DevOps engineers handling **large pipelines or heavy builds** 👏

Let’s go step by step 👇

---

## 🔹 **Problem**

In real-world CI/CD setups, some builds (like large Maven builds, Docker image builds, or SAP module tests) can take **a long time** — sometimes **hours**.
This can cause:

* **Agent timeouts**
* **Queue bottlenecks**
* **Wasted compute**
* **Pipeline failures due to disconnections**

So we need strategies to **handle long-running builds efficiently**.

---

## 🔹 **1. Use Pipeline Checkpoints or Stages**

Split your pipeline into **smaller stages** instead of one huge monolithic build.

```groovy
stage('Build') { ... }
stage('Unit Tests') { ... }
stage('Integration Tests') { ... }
```

✅ If a stage fails, Jenkins can **resume from the last successful stage** using features like:

```groovy
options { skipStagesAfterUnstable() }
```

This prevents rebuilding everything again.

---

## 🔹 **2. Use `agent none` + per-stage agents**

Run only necessary stages on specific agents instead of locking one agent for the entire duration.

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent none
  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      agent { label 'build-node' }
      steps { sh 'mvn clean package' }
    }
    stage('Test') {
      agent { label 'test-node' }
      steps { sh 'mvn test' }
    }
  }
}
```

✅ Efficient use of Jenkins agents — each stage uses resources only when needed.

---

## 🔹 **3. Use `stash` / `unstash` Between Stages**

As explained earlier, stash your artifacts between stages so you don’t rebuild everything.

```groovy
stash name: 'jar', includes: 'target/*.jar'
unstash 'jar'
```

✅ Speeds up long builds across agents.

---

## 🔹 **4. Use `timeout` Blocks**

Set timeouts for stages or steps to automatically abort if they hang.

```groovy
timeout(time: 2, unit: 'HOURS') {
  sh './run-long-tests.sh'
}
```

✅ Prevents agents from getting stuck forever.

---

## 🔹 **5. Use Distributed Builds (Controller-Agent Setup)**

Run long-running builds on **dedicated, high-performance agents** or **Kubernetes pods** (ephemeral agents).

Example (Kubernetes plugin):

```groovy
agent {
  kubernetes {
    yaml '''
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Pod
      spec:
        containers:
          - name: builder
            image: maven:3.9.5-jdk-17
    '''
  }
}
```

✅ On-demand scaling
✅ No resource wastage after build finishes

---

## 🔹 **6. Use Build Caching**

Avoid rebuilding unchanged code.

* Maven → use `.m2` cache
* npm → use `node_modules` cache
* Docker → use layer caching (`--cache-from`)

In Jenkins pipelines:

```groovy
cache(maxCacheSize: 10, caches: [cache('~/.m2/repository')])
```

✅ Huge time saver for repeated builds.

---

## 🔹 **7. Use `parallel` Execution**

If tests or builds can be run independently, execute them in parallel.

```groovy
parallel (
  "Unit Tests": { sh 'mvn test -Dgroups=unit' },
  "Integration Tests": { sh 'mvn test -Dgroups=integration' }
)
```

✅ Reduces total pipeline time drastically.

---

## 🔹 **8. Use `buildDiscarder` and `pipeline durabilityHint`**

In declarative pipelines:

```groovy
options {
  buildDiscarder(logRotator(numToKeepStr: '10'))
  durabilityHint('PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZED')
}
```

✅ Keeps Jenkins lightweight by storing fewer build records.
✅ Durability hint improves performance for long builds.

---

## 🔹 **9. Externalize Long Processes**

Offload heavy jobs (like performance tests or SAP deployments) to external tools like:

* AWS Batch
* Kubernetes Jobs
* Separate asynchronous pipelines

Then use Jenkins only to trigger and monitor them.

✅ Keeps Jenkins responsive and fault-tolerant.

---

## 🔹 **10. Use `checkpoint` or `input` for Manual Steps**

If you have manual approvals in between, add checkpoints:

```groovy
input message: 'Deploy to Production?', ok: 'Deploy'
```

✅ Avoids rerunning the entire pipeline when manual approval is pending.

---

## 🔹 **Interview-Ready Answer**

> “To handle long-running builds efficiently in Jenkins, I break pipelines into smaller stages, use per-stage agents to release resources, and apply caching and parallel execution to speed up processing.
> I also use `stash/unstash` for artifact sharing, set `timeout` blocks to prevent hangs, and run builds on Kubernetes-based ephemeral agents for scalability.
> For extremely long or external tasks, I offload the execution to cloud jobs and let Jenkins monitor progress.”

Jenkins Internal Arch
Perfect 👏 — this is one of the **most frequently asked Jenkins interview questions**, especially for **mid to senior-level DevOps engineers**.

Let’s go step by step — simple, visual, and technical enough to impress an interviewer 👇

---

## 🔹 **Overview: Jenkins Internal Architecture**

Jenkins follows a **Client–Server (Controller–Agent)** architecture, designed to **distribute build workloads** efficiently across multiple machines.

---

### 🧩 **Main Components:**

1. **Jenkins Controller (formerly called Master)**
2. **Jenkins Agent (formerly called Slave)**
3. **Jenkins Web UI / REST API**
4. **Build Queue and Executors**
5. **Plugins**
6. **Jobs and Pipelines**
7. **Jenkins Home Directory**

Let’s break them down 👇

---

## 🔸 **1. Jenkins Controller**

This is the **brain of Jenkins** 💡

**Responsibilities:**

* Managing the **web UI**, **REST API**, and **user requests**
* **Scheduling builds**
* **Distributing jobs** to agents
* **Monitoring** build execution
* **Storing configuration** and job history in the Jenkins home directory

🗂 Configurations, jobs, and logs are stored under:

```
$JENKINS_HOME/
```

Examples:

* `config.xml` → global config
* `jobs/` → job definitions
* `plugins/` → installed plugins
* `workspace/` → build data

---

## 🔸 **2. Jenkins Agents**

These are the **workers** that actually execute the builds.

You can have multiple agents (on different machines, OS, or containers).
Agents communicate with the controller over **JNLP**, **SSH**, or **Kubernetes agents**.

### 💻 Types of Agents:

* **Static agents**: Always online
* **Ephemeral agents**: Created on-demand (e.g., Kubernetes pods)
* **Cloud-based agents**: Spin up via AWS EC2, Azure VM, or GCP

### 🔄 Communication:

* The controller sends the **build job** and **workspace files** to the agent.
* The agent executes build steps (like `mvn clean install`).
* The agent sends results back to the controller.

---

## 🔸 **3. Build Queue and Executors**

### 🧱 **Build Queue:**

When you trigger a build, it goes into the **build queue**.
The controller picks a free **executor** on an available agent to run the job.

### ⚙️ **Executors:**

Each agent (including the controller itself) has one or more **executors** — lightweight threads that can run builds in parallel.

Example:
If an agent has `2` executors, it can handle `2` builds simultaneously.

---

## 🔸 **4. Plugins**

Jenkins is **plugin-driven** (that’s its biggest strength 💪).

Plugins extend Jenkins functionality — from source control to notifications.

🔧 Examples:

* **SCM**: Git, GitHub, Bitbucket
* **Build Tools**: Maven, Gradle, NodeJS
* **CI/CD**: Pipeline, Blue Ocean, Docker, Kubernetes
* **Notifications**: Slack, Email
* **Security**: Credentials Binding, Role Strategy

Over **1,800+ plugins** are available in the Jenkins community.

---

## 🔸 **5. Jobs & Pipelines**

Jobs are **units of work** in Jenkins.
You define what to build, test, or deploy.

🧩 Types of Jobs:

* Freestyle Jobs
* Pipeline Jobs (Declarative or Scripted)
* Multibranch Pipelines
* Folder/Matrix Jobs

🧠 Pipelines are Groovy-based and stored as **`Jenkinsfile`** in your repo.

---

## 🔸 **6. Jenkins Web UI & API**

* Web UI for creating, managing, and monitoring builds.
* REST API for automation and integration with other tools (like GitHub, Slack, or Jira).

---

## 🔸 **7. Jenkins Home Directory**

All persistent data is stored in `$JENKINS_HOME`, such as:

* Configuration files
* Plugins
* Credentials
* Logs
* Job data

📁 Default paths:

```
/var/lib/jenkins/
C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\
```

---

## 🔹 **🧭 How It All Works (Step-by-Step Flow)**

### **1️⃣ User triggers a build**

* From UI, Git webhook, or SCM polling.

### **2️⃣ Controller queues the job**

* Job goes to **build queue** until a free agent is available.

### **3️⃣ Controller assigns job to agent**

* Based on labels, node availability, or load.

### **4️⃣ Agent executes the build**

* Pulls code from Git.
* Runs build commands (`mvn clean install`, `npm run test`, etc.).
* Generates reports/artifacts.

### **5️⃣ Results sent back to Controller**

* Controller stores logs, test reports, and artifacts.

### **6️⃣ Notifications**

* Jenkins sends results (Slack, email, etc.) and triggers downstream jobs.

How do you back up and restore Jenkins configuration?
Excellent question 💡 — this is something interviewers love to ask because it checks both your **Jenkins admin knowledge** and **disaster recovery understanding**.

Here’s the **complete and clear explanation** 👇

---

## 🔹 **How Jenkins Configuration is Stored**

All Jenkins configuration (including jobs, plugins, credentials, and system settings) is stored inside the **JENKINS_HOME** directory on the server.

Typical path:

```
/var/lib/jenkins
```

Inside it, you’ll find:

| Path                          | What it stores                          |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `/var/lib/jenkins/config.xml` | Global Jenkins configuration            |
| `/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/`      | Each job’s config.xml and build history |
| `/var/lib/jenkins/users/`     | User accounts and settings              |
| `/var/lib/jenkins/plugins/`   | Installed plugin files                  |
| `/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/`   | Credentials and security keys           |
| `/var/lib/jenkins/nodes/`     | Node (agent) configurations             |

---

## 🔹 **Backup Process**

### 🧭 Option 1 — Manual Backup (Simple)

1. **Stop Jenkins** service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop jenkins
   ```
2. **Copy the JENKINS_HOME directory** to a backup location:

   ```bash
   sudo cp -r /var/lib/jenkins /backup/jenkins_$(date +%F)
   ```
3. **Start Jenkins** again:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start jenkins
   ```

> 🔒 Tip: Make sure you also back up the `/secrets/` folder — it contains credential keys.

---

### 🧭 Option 2 — While Jenkins is Running (Live Backup)

You can take a **hot backup** using `rsync`:

```bash
rsync -a --delete /var/lib/jenkins/ /backup/jenkins_backup/
```

This works because most Jenkins data is XML-based and safe to copy live.

---

### 🧭 Option 3 — Using Plugins

Use the **ThinBackup Plugin** or **Backup Plugin**:

* Schedule periodic backups of jobs, configs, and plugins.
* Can automatically store them in a specific folder or cloud bucket.

---

## 🔹 **Restore Process**

To restore Jenkins:

1. Stop Jenkins:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop jenkins
   ```
2. Replace the current Jenkins home with your backup:

   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf /var/lib/jenkins
   sudo cp -r /backup/jenkins_backup /var/lib/jenkins
   ```
3. Ensure ownership:

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins
   ```
4. Start Jenkins again:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start jenkins
   ```

✅ Jenkins will start with all jobs, credentials, and configurations intact.

---

## 🔹 **In Short (Interview Answer)**

> “All Jenkins configurations are stored under the JENKINS_HOME directory.
> To back up Jenkins, we copy this directory — especially `config.xml`, `jobs/`, `plugins/`, and `secrets/`.
> During restore, we stop Jenkins, replace the folder with the backup, fix permissions, and start Jenkins again.
> Optionally, we can automate backups using the ThinBackup plugin.”

---
How do you handle pipeline failures and retries automatically?
Excellent 💪 — this is one of the **most important Jenkins interview topics**, especially for CI/CD pipelines that must be reliable (like your SAP Project Piper setup).

Let’s go through it **clearly and practically**, with examples 👇

---

## 🔹 **Goal**

Handle **pipeline failures** gracefully and **retry automatically** when:

* A step fails due to temporary issues (like network or build agent hiccups)
* You want resilience without manual re-runs

---

## 🔹 **1️⃣ Using the `retry` Step (Declarative Pipeline)**

You can retry a block of code automatically a specific number of times.

### ✅ Example:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                retry(3) {
                    echo "Attempting build..."
                    sh 'mvn clean install'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

🧠 Explanation:

* Jenkins will **retry this block up to 3 times** if any command fails.
* If it still fails after 3 attempts → the stage fails.
* Useful for **transient network issues or flaky builds**.

---

## 🔹 **2️⃣ Using `catchError` to Prevent Entire Pipeline Failure**

You can catch a failure but continue the rest of the pipeline.

### ✅ Example:

```groovy
stage('Test') {
    steps {
        catchError(buildResult: 'SUCCESS', stageResult: 'FAILURE') {
            sh 'mvn test'
        }
    }
}
```

🧠 Explanation:

* Marks this stage as *failed* but the **pipeline continues**.
* Good for **non-blocking checks** (e.g., linting, static analysis).

---

## 🔹 **3️⃣ Using `try...catch` (Scripted Pipeline)**

For more control or when using custom Groovy logic:

### ✅ Example:

```groovy
node {
    try {
        sh 'npm install'
        sh 'npm test'
    } catch (err) {
        echo "Build failed: ${err}"
        currentBuild.result = 'FAILURE'
        // Optional retry logic
    }
}
```

🧠 You can add custom notifications, conditional retries, or cleanups.

---

## 🔹 **4️⃣ Using `post` Block for Failure Actions**

Even if the pipeline fails, you can trigger specific actions in a `post` block.

### ✅ Example:

```groovy
post {
    failure {
        echo "Sending alert: Build failed!"
        // Example: send Slack/email notification
    }
    success {
        echo "Build succeeded!"
    }
}
```

🧠 Great for sending alerts, cleaning up, or pushing logs.

---

## 🔹 **5️⃣ Using `timeout` + `retry` Together**

Prevents infinite hanging builds.

### ✅ Example:

```groovy
retry(2) {
    timeout(time: 10, unit: 'MINUTES') {
        sh 'mvn deploy'
    }
}
```

🧠 Jenkins will retry the deploy step twice if it fails,
and each try will timeout after 10 minutes.

---

## 🔹 **6️⃣ In SAP Project Piper Context**

In **Piper pipelines**, retry logic is often handled via:

* `retryCount` parameters in `.pipeline/config.yml`
* Custom `stageRetry` in Piper steps
* Or via shared library wrappers around Jenkins steps

For example:

```yaml
steps:
  mavenExecute:
    retryCount: 3
```

Piper internally uses similar retry mechanisms as `retry {}`.

---

## 🔹 **✅ Interview-Ready Summary**

> “In Jenkins, we handle pipeline failures using the `retry` step to automatically re-run flaky stages, `catchError` to continue execution after a failure, and `post` blocks to handle failure notifications or cleanup.
> We can also use `timeout` with `retry` for better control.
> In SAP Piper pipelines, retries are often configured via parameters like `retryCount` in the YAML configuration.”

How can you integrate Jenkins with Docker and Kubernetes?
🔥 Excellent — this is a **core DevOps interview question**, especially relevant for your background (SAP + Jenkins + Kubernetes).
Let’s break it down step by step so you can **explain it confidently in interviews** 👇

---

## 🧩 **Goal**

Integrating Jenkins with **Docker** and **Kubernetes** allows you to:
✅ Build, test, and package apps in **Docker containers**
✅ Deploy them automatically into **Kubernetes clusters**
✅ Achieve full CI/CD automation

---

## 🔹 **1️⃣ Jenkins + Docker Integration**

### 🧭 **Purpose**

* To **build Docker images** from your source code
* Push those images to a registry (like **JFrog Artifactory**, **DockerHub**, or **ECR**)

---

### ✅ **Setup Steps**

#### 🔸 1. Install Docker on Jenkins build node

Ensure Jenkins can run Docker commands:

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
```

#### 🔸 2. Install Jenkins Plugins

* **Docker Pipeline Plugin**
* **Docker Commons Plugin**
* **CloudBees Docker Build and Publish Plugin**

---

### ✅ **Example: Build and Push Docker Image**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                script {
                    dockerImage = docker.build("myapp:${env.BUILD_NUMBER}")
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Push Image to JFrog') {
            steps {
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'jfrog-creds', usernameVariable: 'USER', passwordVariable: 'PASS')]) {
                    sh """
                        echo "$PASS" | docker login my.jfrog.io -u "$USER" --password-stdin
                        docker tag myapp:${env.BUILD_NUMBER} my.jfrog.io/myrepo/myapp:${env.BUILD_NUMBER}
                        docker push my.jfrog.io/myrepo/myapp:${env.BUILD_NUMBER}
                    """
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

🧠 **What happens:**

* Jenkins builds a Docker image
* Tags it
* Pushes it to **JFrog Artifactory** (your case)

---

## 🔹 **2️⃣ Jenkins + Kubernetes Integration**

### 🧭 **Purpose**

* Run Jenkins agents as **pods** inside Kubernetes
* Deploy your app directly to Kubernetes from the pipeline

---

### ✅ **Setup Approaches**

#### 🔸 Option 1: Jenkins *runs inside Kubernetes* (modern approach)

* Deploy Jenkins as a **pod** using Helm or YAML
* Use **Kubernetes Plugin** for dynamic agents

Example:

```bash
helm install jenkins jenkinsci/jenkins --namespace jenkins
```

Then configure `Kubernetes Cloud` in Jenkins UI with:

* Master URL → your cluster API server
* Credentials → Service Account token
* Pod template → Define what kind of build agent to spin up

💡 Each build will automatically run inside a temporary pod (isolated and auto-cleaned).

---

#### 🔸 Option 2: Jenkins *outside Kubernetes* but deploys to it

* Jenkins is hosted on a VM or EC2
* Uses `kubectl` commands (via Kubeconfig or Service Account)

Example stage:

```groovy
stage('Deploy to Kubernetes') {
    steps {
        withKubeConfig(credentialsId: 'kubeconfig') {
            sh 'kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml'
        }
    }
}
```

### ✅ **SAP Project Piper Context**

In **SAP CI/CD with Piper**, deployment to Kubernetes is typically done through Piper steps like:

```yaml
steps:
  kubernetesDeploy:
    kubeConfigCredentialsId: 'kubeconfig'
    containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: my.jfrog.io/myrepo/myapp:${GIT_COMMIT}
```

Here Piper automatically handles:

* Applying manifests
* Managing namespaces
* Reporting deployment status

---

## 🔹 **3️⃣ Jenkins + Docker + Kubernetes (Combined Flow)**

Full CI/CD flow:

1. Jenkins checks out code from GitHub
2. Builds Docker image
3. Pushes image to JFrog
4. Updates Kubernetes deployment YAML with new image tag
5. Deploys to cluster

---

### ✅ **Example Combined Declarative Pipeline**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }

        stage('Build & Push Image') {
            steps {
                script {
                    dockerImage = docker.build("myapp:${env.BUILD_NUMBER}")
                    docker.withRegistry('https://my.jfrog.io', 'jfrog-creds') {
                        dockerImage.push()
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy to K8s') {
            steps {
                withKubeConfig(credentialsId: 'kubeconfig') {
                    sh """
                    kubectl set image deployment/myapp myapp=my.jfrog.io/myrepo/myapp:${env.BUILD_NUMBER} -n prod
                    kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp -n prod
                    """
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## 🔹 **✅ Interview-Ready Summary**

> “We integrate Jenkins with Docker to build and push container images automatically during the CI process.
> Then, Jenkins connects to Kubernetes either via the Kubernetes plugin (dynamic agents) or via `kubectl` to deploy updated images.
> In SAP environments, we use Piper steps like `kubernetesDeploy` and store images in JFrog.
> This setup enables full CI/CD automation from code to container to cluster.”

What is the purpose of the input step in pipelines?
Excellent 💡 — this is a very common Jenkins interview question and easy to impress the interviewer if you explain it clearly and with an example.

Let’s go step by step 👇

---

## 🔹 **Purpose of the `input` Step**

The **`input` step** in a Jenkins pipeline is used to **pause the pipeline and wait for manual approval or user input** before continuing to the next stage.

It’s a **manual checkpoint** that allows human intervention — for example:
✅ To approve a deployment to production
✅ To choose an environment or version
✅ To verify test results before proceeding

---

## 🔹 **How It Works**

When the pipeline reaches an `input` step:

* Jenkins **pauses** the pipeline execution.
* It shows a **prompt in the Jenkins UI** asking for user confirmation or input.
* Once a user (with proper permissions) provides input or approves,
  → the pipeline **resumes** execution.

If nobody approves, it stays paused until it times out or is aborted manually.

---

## 🔹 **✅ Example 1 — Simple Manual Approval**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo "Building application..."
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy to Prod') {
            steps {
                input message: 'Approve deployment to Production?', ok: 'Deploy'
                echo "Deploying to Production..."
            }
        }
    }
}
```

🧠 **Explanation:**

* The pipeline will pause at “Approve deployment to Production?”
* A user must click the **“Deploy”** button in Jenkins UI.
* After approval → pipeline continues with deployment.

---

## 🔹 **✅ Example 2 — Collecting User Input**

```groovy
stage('User Confirmation') {
    steps {
        script {
            def userInput = input(
                message: 'Choose the environment:',
                parameters: [
                    choice(name: 'ENV', choices: ['dev', 'qa', 'prod'], description: 'Select environment')
                ]
            )
            echo "Deploying to ${userInput.ENV} environment"
        }
    }
}
```

🧠 **Explanation:**

* Jenkins shows a dropdown with options: `dev`, `qa`, `prod`.
* Based on the user’s selection, the pipeline continues accordingly.

---

## 🔹 **✅ Example 3 — Timeouts and Conditions**

You can combine `input` with `timeout` to automatically cancel after a while:

```groovy
stage('Approval') {
    steps {
        timeout(time: 1, unit: 'HOURS') {
            input message: 'Deploy to production?', ok: 'Yes, proceed'
        }
    }
}
```

If no one approves within 1 hour → pipeline fails automatically.

---

## 🔹 **Why It’s Useful**

| Use Case                     | Description                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 🛑 **Manual Approvals**      | Stop before production deployment    |
| ⚙️ **Environment Selection** | Let users choose target environment  |
| 🧪 **QA/Testing Gates**      | Wait for tester validation           |
| 🔐 **Controlled Releases**   | Combine automation + human oversight |

---

## 🔹 **⚠️ Limitations**

* Pipelines pause and occupy executor slots while waiting for approval.
* Should not be overused in fully automated CI/CD (use only for critical manual checkpoints).

---

## 🔹 **✅ Interview-Ready Summary**

> “The `input` step in Jenkins pipelines is used to pause the execution and wait for manual user input or approval before proceeding.
> It’s commonly used for deployment approvals or quality gates.
> For example, before deploying to production, the pipeline can prompt a release manager to approve or reject the step.
> Once approved, the pipeline resumes automatically.”
