## 🔴 **Scenario-Based Jenkins Questions**

1. 🧩 *Your Jenkins build fails randomly — how do you troubleshoot it?*

2. 🧩 *You have 10 microservices; how do you design a CI/CD pipeline for them?*

3. 🧩 *Your Jenkins master is slow; how do you optimize it?*

4. 🧩 *You want to deploy only when tests pass — how do you enforce it in Jenkinsfile?*

5. 🧩 *You need to use different credentials for different environments — how do you manage them?*

6. 🧩 *You want to build automatically whenever a PR is merged in GitHub — how do you set it up?*

7. 🧩 *You want to reuse pipeline code across multiple repositories — how do you do that?*
   → Use **Shared Libraries**.

8. 🧩 *You need to promote builds from dev → test → prod automatically — how?*
   → Use **multi-stage pipelines** with conditional triggers.

9. 🧩 *You want Jenkins to deploy on Kubernetes — how do you configure it?*
   → Use `kubernetes` plugin or Helm + Jenkins Agent in cluster.

10. 🧩 *You want to skip tests in Jenkins Maven build — which command do you use?*
    → `mvn clean install -DskipTests=true`.
