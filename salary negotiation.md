Here’s a clean, confident way to negotiate and push them closer to **20 LPA**, even if their “band” is 18.

# ✅ **How to Negotiate From 18 → 20 LPA (Step-by-step)**

### **1️⃣ Start with appreciation + interest**

Always open positively.

**Example:**
“Thank you for the offer. I’m genuinely excited about Deloitte and the role.”

This sets the tone.

---

# **2️⃣ Anchor your expected number (20–21 LPA)**

Never say only 20 — give a range where 20 is the middle, not the maximum.

**Say this:**
“Based on the role’s responsibilities and my current experience in AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, Linux, CI/CD and my current market value, I was expecting **20–21 LPA fixed**.”

Once you anchor at 21, getting 20 looks easier.

---

# **3️⃣ Justify — don’t beg**

Salary increases happen only when you attach a **business reason**.

You can say:

* “I bring 5+ years in core DevOps and cloud migration experience.”
* “I can contribute immediately with my expertise in CI/CD, EKS, and automation.”
* “This reduces training/onboarding effort for Deloitte.”

This makes you look like a strong asset, not a cost.

---

# **4️⃣ Use your alternate leverage**

Even if you don’t have another offer, you can say:

**“I am in the final stages with another company where the compensation aligns more with my expectation of 20+ LPA.”**

This is a very standard negotiation line.

---

# **5️⃣ Give a middle-ground option**

If they still say “18 is max,” propose:

👉 **Option A:** 20 LPA fixed
👉 **Option B:** 18 LPA fixed + 2 LPA joining bonus
👉 **Option C:** 18 LPA fixed + re-evaluation in 6 months

Companies use bonuses to bypass budget caps — VERY common.

---

# **6️⃣ Final push line (use this word-to-word)**

Here’s the strongest line:

**“If Deloitte can revise the offer to 20 LPA, I can confirm immediately. Deloitte is my first preference.”**

This shows commitment + pressure in a polite way.

# 📌 **Complete Negotiation Script (You can send this!)**

**Hi <HR Name>,**

Thank you so much for the offer. I’m really excited about the role and the opportunity to work with Deloitte.

Considering my 5+ years of experience in AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD, and production-grade DevOps responsibilities, my expected compensation is **20–21 LPA**.

If Deloitte can revise the offer to **20 LPA**, I can confirm immediately.
If there is a band limitation, I would be open to:

* **18 LPA + joining bonus**, or
* **18 LPA with a compensation review in 6 months**.

I’m keen to join Deloitte, and I hope we can arrive at a mutually aligned number.

Thanks again!

# 🧠 **Realistic outcome**

If you negotiate properly, Deloitte usually will:

* Increase from **18 → 19 or 19.5 LPA**, OR
* Keep 18 and add **1–2 LPA joining bonus**

But you can definitely push — they expect it.
