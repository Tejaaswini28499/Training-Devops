Docker storage means **how and where Docker stores data** ‚Äî including container filesystems, images, volumes, and logs. Since containers are lightweight and ephemeral, Docker provides multiple ways to persist and manage data.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

---

### 1. **Layers & Union File System**

* Every Docker **image** is made of **read-only layers**.
* When you start a container, Docker adds a **thin writable layer** (called the *container layer*) on top of the image layers.
* Any changes inside the container (like new files or modifications) go into this writable layer.
* When the container is deleted, this writable layer is also deleted ‚Üí meaning changes are lost unless you use **volumes** or **bind mounts**.

---

### 2. **Storage Drivers**

Docker uses **storage drivers** to manage these layers.
Examples:

* **overlay2** (default on modern Linux)
* **aufs**, **btrfs**, **zfs**, **devicemapper** (older or specialized setups)

They decide *how* files and layers are combined and stored on disk.

---

### 3. **Persistent Storage Options**

Since container layers are temporary, Docker provides persistent storage methods:

#### a) **Volumes**

* Managed by Docker (`docker volume create`).
* Stored under `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`.
* Independent of containers ‚Üí safe for databases or app data.
* Example in `docker-compose.yml`:

  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
  ```

#### b) **Bind Mounts**

* Link a directory on the host to a container path.
* Example:

  ```bash
  docker run -v /home/user/data:/data my-container
  ```
* Any changes sync between host and container.

#### c) **tmpfs Mounts**

* Store data in **host memory** (not written to disk).
* Useful for sensitive data or fast temporary storage.
* Example:

  ```bash
  docker run --tmpfs /app/cache my-container
  ```

---

### 4. **Where Docker Stores Data**

* By default, under `/var/lib/docker/`

  * `overlay2/` ‚Üí image and container layers
  * `volumes/` ‚Üí named volumes
  * `containers/` ‚Üí container metadata & logs

---

‚úÖ **In short:**

* Docker storage = how Docker saves images, containers, and persistent data.
* Ephemeral: container layer.
* Persistent: volumes & bind mounts.

Great follow-up üëç

When we say *"non-Docker processes"*, we simply mean \*\*any process, service, or program running on the host machine that is **outside of Docker‚Äôs control**.

---

### üîπ **Docker processes**

* Commands and daemons started by Docker itself:

  * `dockerd` (the Docker daemon)
  * `docker run`, `docker exec`, `docker volume`
  * Container processes (apps running *inside* Docker)

These **know how to safely handle volumes**.

---

### üîπ **Non-Docker processes**

* Anything else running **directly on the host OS**, for example:

  * A text editor like `vim` or `nano` modifying files under `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`
  * Host services (e.g., `systemd`, `cron`, `mysql`, `nginx`) accessing those paths directly
  * File copy operations (`cp`, `mv`, `rm`) in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`
  * Backup/cleanup scripts that delete or alter files inside that directory

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why avoid them?

* Docker expects volumes to be managed only via Docker commands.
* If an external process changes or deletes files in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`, it can:

  * Corrupt container data
  * Cause permission issues
  * Break running containers
  * Lead to unexpected data loss

---

‚úÖ **In simple terms:**
Non-Docker processes = **anything on your host system that isn‚Äôt part of Docker itself**. You should manage volumes using `docker volume` commands, not by directly editing files in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`.

---

Do you want me to give a **real-world example** of how a non-Docker process could accidentally corrupt a Docker volume?
