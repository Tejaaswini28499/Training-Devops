Docker storage means **how and where Docker stores data** — including container filesystems, images, volumes, and logs. Since containers are lightweight and ephemeral, Docker provides multiple ways to persist and manage data.

Here’s a breakdown:

---

### 1. **Layers & Union File System**

* Every Docker **image** is made of **read-only layers**.
* When you start a container, Docker adds a **thin writable layer** (called the *container layer*) on top of the image layers.
* Any changes inside the container (like new files or modifications) go into this writable layer.
* When the container is deleted, this writable layer is also deleted → meaning changes are lost unless you use **volumes** or **bind mounts**.

---

### 2. **Storage Drivers**

Docker uses **storage drivers** to manage these layers.
Examples:

* **overlay2** (default on modern Linux)
* **aufs**, **btrfs**, **zfs**, **devicemapper** (older or specialized setups)

They decide *how* files and layers are combined and stored on disk.

---

### 3. **Persistent Storage Options**

Since container layers are temporary, Docker provides persistent storage methods:

#### a) **Volumes**

* Managed by Docker (`docker volume create`).
* Stored under `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`.
* Independent of containers → safe for databases or app data.
* Example in `docker-compose.yml`:

  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
  ```

#### b) **Bind Mounts**

* Link a directory on the host to a container path.
* Example:

  ```bash
  docker run -v /home/user/data:/data my-container
  ```
* Any changes sync between host and container.

#### c) **tmpfs Mounts**

* Store data in **host memory** (not written to disk).
* Useful for sensitive data or fast temporary storage.
* Example:

  ```bash
  docker run --tmpfs /app/cache my-container
  ```

---

### 4. **Where Docker Stores Data**

* By default, under `/var/lib/docker/`

  * `overlay2/` → image and container layers
  * `volumes/` → named volumes
  * `containers/` → container metadata & logs

---

✅ **In short:**

* Docker storage = how Docker saves images, containers, and persistent data.
* Ephemeral: container layer.
* Persistent: volumes & bind mounts.

Do you want me to also explain **how storage differs between `volumes`, `bind mounts`, and container writable layers** with a simple comparison table?
