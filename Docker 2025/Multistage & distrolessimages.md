Great question 👍 Let’s break this into **two concepts**:

## 1. **Multi-Stage Dockerfile**

Multi-stage builds help you create **smaller, cleaner images** by separating the build environment from the runtime environment.

* In the first stage(s), you use a full image with compilers/tools to build your app.
* In the final stage, you copy only the **necessary output** (binaries, dependencies, configs) into a lightweight base image.

👉 Example: **Go Application**

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM golang:1.21 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp .

# Stage 2: Run
FROM gcr.io/distroless/base-debian12   # distroless image
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /myapp
ENTRYPOINT ["/myapp"]
```

✅ Benefits:

* Final image does **not include Go compiler** or build tools.
* Smaller size, fewer attack surfaces.

---

## 2. **Distroless Images**

Distroless images are minimal Docker images maintained by Google.

* They contain only the **application runtime libraries**, no shell, package manager, or extra tools.
* Example: `gcr.io/distroless/base`, `gcr.io/distroless/java`, `gcr.io/distroless/nodejs`.
* You can’t do `apt-get`, `bash`, or `sh` inside them → improves **security**.

👉 Example: **Node.js App**

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:20 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production
COPY . .

# Stage 2: Run
FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs20
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app /app
CMD ["server.js"]
```

✅ Benefits of **distroless**:

* **Security**: No extra binaries → smaller attack surface.
* **Smaller images**: Only runtime + your app.
* **Compliance**: Easier vulnerability scans, fewer CVEs.

❌ Downsides:

* Debugging is harder (no shell).
* Must use `docker exec` with debuggers/logs instead.

---

### ⚖️ Multi-Stage + Distroless = Best Practice

* Use multi-stage to **build efficiently**.
* Use distroless in final stage to **run securely**.

👉 Do you want me to show you **a real example with Java (Maven → JAR → Distroless Java)** since you’re working with pipelines, or should I stick with Go/Node?
