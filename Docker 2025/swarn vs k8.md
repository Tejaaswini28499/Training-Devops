Docker Swarm supports auto load balancing.                                       Kubernetes does not have a support for auto load balancing.

Docker Swarm does not support auto scaling. Manual scaling has to be configured. Kubernetes offers auto scaling.

Docker Swarm uses third party tools for monitoring                               Kubernetes has built in monitoring.

Docker Swarm is simpler to install and set up.                                   Kubernetes is much more complex to install and set up.

For Docker Swarm you don't have to learn a new command-line tool.                For Kubernetes, you must learn how to use Kubectl.

Docker Swarm is lightweight and limited in functionality.                        Kubernetes has a higher learning curve and is more powerful.
