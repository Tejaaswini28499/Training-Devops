what is the reason when using modules in terraform the terraformtf.var files are not requried?
Excellent question — this is a common point of confusion in **Terraform** when people start using **modules** 👏

Let’s break it down clearly 👇

---

### 🔹 1. What `terraform.tfvars` Normally Does

In a **non-modular** Terraform setup:

* You define input variables in your root configuration (like `variables.tf`).
* You provide values for those variables in a `terraform.tfvars` or `*.auto.tfvars` file.
* Terraform automatically loads those values when you run `terraform plan` or `apply`.

Example:

```hcl
# variables.tf
variable "region" {}

# terraform.tfvars
region = "ap-south-1"
```

This works fine when everything is defined in one place.

---

### 🔹 2. What Happens When You Use Modules

When you use **modules**, there are now two layers:

#### 🏠 Root Module

This is your main configuration — the one where you run `terraform apply`.

#### 📦 Child Module(s)

These are reusable pieces of Terraform code, often stored in `modules/` directories or external repos.

Example:

```hcl
module "network" {
  source = "./modules/network"
  region = var.region
}
```

---

### 🔹 3. Why `terraform.tfvars` is Not Needed *Inside* Modules

Modules are meant to be **reusable and isolated**.
They **should not depend** on external files like `terraform.tfvars`.

Instead, **the root module** (where you run Terraform) is responsible for passing variable values **into** the child module.

So you define variables in the module like this:

```hcl
# modules/network/variables.tf
variable "region" {}
```

And then in the root module, you pass values:

```hcl
# main.tf
module "network" {
  source = "./modules/network"
  region = var.region
}
```

If you already have `terraform.tfvars` in the root:

```hcl
# terraform.tfvars
region = "ap-south-1"
```

Then Terraform automatically loads this value and passes it to the module through the `var.region` reference.

✅ **Result:**

* You only need one `terraform.tfvars` file — in the root.
* Modules get their values via inputs from the root, not from their own `tfvars`.

### 🔹 4. Summary Table

| Concept                     | Without Modules              | With Modules                                      |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Where variables are defined | In `variables.tf`            | In module’s `variables.tf`                        |
| Where values are assigned   | In `terraform.tfvars`        | In root module (can use `terraform.tfvars` there) |
| Who loads the tfvars        | Terraform root automatically | Module does **not** load tfvars                   |
| Why                         | Simpler, single config       | Modules are reusable and isolated                 |

---

### 💡 In short:

> When using **modules**, the `terraform.tfvars` file is only needed at the **root level**, because the root module is responsible for providing inputs to all the child modules.
> Child modules **should not depend** on tfvars directly — they get their values through variable inputs.

Would you like me to show you a **small folder structure example** (with module + tfvars) so you can visualize how it flows?
