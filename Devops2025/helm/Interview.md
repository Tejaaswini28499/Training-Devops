## üß© **Basic Helm Interview Questions**

1. **What is Helm?**

   * Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps you define, install, and manage Kubernetes applications using *charts*.

2. **What is a Helm chart?**

   * A Helm chart is a package containing all the resource definitions (YAML files) required to deploy an application on Kubernetes.

3. **What is a Helm release?**

   * A *release* is an instance of a Helm chart running in a Kubernetes cluster.

4. **What is the difference between a chart and a release?**

   * Chart = Template
     Release = Deployed instance of that template with specific values.

5. **What files are mandatory in a Helm chart?**

   * `Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`, and `templates/` directory.

6. **What does the `values.yaml` file do?**

   * It contains default configuration values for your Helm chart templates.

7. **How do you install a Helm chart?**

   ```bash
   helm install <release-name> <chart-path>
   ```

8. **How do you upgrade an existing release?**

   ```bash
   helm upgrade <release-name> <chart-path>
   ```

9. **How do you rollback a release?**

   ```bash
   helm rollback <release-name> <revision>
   ```

10. **How do you list all releases in a namespace?**

    ```bash
    helm list -n <namespace>
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Intermediate Helm Interview Questions**

11. **What is the purpose of `Chart.yaml`?**

* It defines chart metadata (name, version, description, dependencies, maintainers, etc.)

12. **What is the use of `templates/` folder in a Helm chart?**

* It contains Kubernetes manifest templates written in YAML + Go templating syntax.

13. **Explain how Helm templating works.**

* Helm uses the Go templating engine. It replaces placeholders (`{{ }}`) with actual values from `values.yaml` or CLI overrides.

14. **How can you override default values in Helm?**

* Using `--set` or `-f custom-values.yaml` during install/upgrade.

Example:

```bash
helm install myapp ./chart --set image.tag=v2
```

15. **How do you debug Helm templates?**

```bash
helm template <chart> --debug
helm install <release> <chart> --dry-run --debug
```

16. **What is the difference between `helm install` and `helm upgrade --install`?**

* `install` ‚Üí only installs
  `upgrade --install` ‚Üí installs if not present, otherwise upgrades.

17. **What is a Helm repository?**

* A place where Helm charts are stored and shared (like Docker Hub for images).

18. **How do you add and search a Helm repo?**

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm search repo nginx
```

19. **What is the `requirements.yaml` (or `dependencies:` in `Chart.yaml`)?**

* Used to define chart dependencies (subcharts).

20. **What are subcharts in Helm?**

* Child charts that can be included as dependencies inside a parent chart.

## üöÄ **Advanced Helm Interview Questions**

21. **How does Helm manage multiple clusters?**

* Helm uses the current Kubernetes context from your `kubeconfig`.
  You can switch clusters using:

  ```bash
  kubectl config use-context <cluster-name>
  ```

  Helm applies charts to whichever cluster your `kubectl` context is set to.

22. **How do you handle secrets in Helm charts?**

* Using:

  * **Helm Secrets plugin** (encrypts with SOPS/GPG)
  * **External secret managers** (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager or sealed-secrets)

23. **How do you store and version control Helm charts in Git?**

* Keep chart code in a Git repo, use `helm package` to version, and host on a chart repo (e.g., GitHub Pages, ChartMuseum).

24. **How does Helm compare with Kustomize?**

* Helm = templating + versioning
  Kustomize = overlay-based customization (no templating engine)

25. **Explain Helm hooks.**

* Hooks allow you to run scripts or jobs before/after lifecycle events (like install, upgrade, delete).
* Example: run a database migration before deployment.

26. **How do you test a Helm chart?**

* Use:

  ```bash
  helm lint ./chart
  helm test <release-name>
  ```

27. **What is Helmfile and why is it used?**

* Helmfile manages multiple Helm releases declaratively. It helps in deploying multiple charts with a single config file.

28. **How do you automate Helm deployments in CI/CD?**

* Use Helm CLI commands in Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Argo CD pipelines.

29. **What is the difference between `helm uninstall` and `kubectl delete`?**

* `helm uninstall` cleans up release metadata and history.
  `kubectl delete` removes only Kubernetes objects, not Helm records.

30. **How do you rollback automatically if Helm upgrade fails?**

* Use:

  ```bash
  helm upgrade --atomic
  ```

  It ensures rollback on failure.

## üéØ **Scenario-Based Helm Questions**

31. **You have multiple clusters (dev, QA, prod). How does Helm know which one to deploy to?**

* Helm uses the active Kubernetes context from `~/.kube/config`.
  You can set it with:

  ```bash
  kubectl config use-context dev-cluster
  ```

32. **Your Helm release failed mid-deployment. What will you do?**

* Run:

  ```bash
  helm status <release>
  helm rollback <release> <previous-revision>
  ```

33. **You need different values for dev, staging, prod environments. What‚Äôs your approach?**

* Maintain multiple `values-<env>.yaml` files and use:

  ```bash
  helm install myapp -f values-prod.yaml
  ```

34. **How do you handle image tag versioning dynamically in CI/CD?**

* Pass image tag as a variable:

  ```bash
  helm upgrade myapp ./chart --set image.tag=${GIT_COMMIT}
  ```

35. **How do you verify what manifests Helm will generate before applying?**

* Use:

  ```bash
  helm template ./chart
  ```

36. **You modified a Helm chart but need to test without affecting running releases.**

* Use `helm template` with `--dry-run` or deploy to a test namespace.

37. **How do you use Helm in ArgoCD or Flux?**

* Define Helm charts as applications in GitOps tools, passing values through Helm parameters.

38. **How do you migrate from Helm v2 to v3?**

* Use:

  ```bash
  helm 2to3 convert <release-name>
  ```

39. **Your chart has multiple subcharts. You only want to enable one.**

* Set value:

  ```yaml
  subchartA:
    enabled: true
  subchartB:
    enabled: false
  ```

40. **How do you handle chart version mismatches in CI/CD?**

* Use semantic versioning (`version: 1.2.3`) and lock dependencies in `Chart.lock`.
