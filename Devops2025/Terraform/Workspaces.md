In **Terraform**, **workspaces** are a way to manage **multiple instances of the same infrastructure** within a single Terraform configuration — for example, creating separate environments like `dev`, `test`, and `prod` without duplicating your `.tf` files.

Let’s break it down 👇

---

### 🌱 What is a Terraform Workspace?

A **workspace** is like a **separate state environment** within the same configuration directory.
Each workspace has its **own state file** — so you can apply the same Terraform code to different environments independently.

---

### 🧠 Example Scenario

Suppose you have this Terraform code:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-app-${terraform.workspace}"
}
```

Now, depending on which workspace you’re in:

* In the `default` workspace → bucket name = `my-app-default`
* In the `dev` workspace → bucket name = `my-app-dev`
* In the `prod` workspace → bucket name = `my-app-prod`

✅ This allows using the same code for multiple environments.

### ⚙️ Common Terraform Workspace Commands

| Command                             | Description                             |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `terraform workspace list`          | List all workspaces                     |
| `terraform workspace show`          | Show the current workspace              |
| `terraform workspace new <name>`    | Create a new workspace                  |
| `terraform workspace select <name>` | Switch to another workspace             |
| `terraform workspace delete <name>` | Delete a workspace (must not be active) |

---

### 🧩 Example Flow

```bash
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Create new workspaces
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new prod

# List available workspaces
terraform workspace list

# Switch to dev workspace
terraform workspace select dev

# Apply Terraform in dev environment
terraform apply

# Switch to prod workspace
terraform workspace select prod
terraform apply
```

Each workspace will have its **own state file** under `.terraform/` directory.

---

### 📂 State File Structure

Terraform keeps workspace states like this:

```
.terraform/
├── environment/
│   ├── dev.tfstate
│   ├── prod.tfstate
│   └── default.tfstate
```

So your changes in `dev` won’t affect `prod`.

---

### 🚫 Limitations

* Workspaces are **not a full environment isolation tool** — backend configurations and variables are shared.
* For large or complex environments, it’s often better to use **separate state backends** or **different directories/repos**.

---

### 🧭 When to Use Workspaces

✅ Good for:

* Simple multi-environment management (dev/test/prod)
* Quickly testing infrastructure changes

❌ Avoid for:

* Complex production systems with many backend configurations
* Separate cloud accounts or isolated networking

Would you like me to show a **real example** of using workspaces with AWS (like S3 + EC2 in `dev` and `prod`) so you can see how the state and resource names differ?

how to use workspace with remote backend
Excellent question 👏 — using **Terraform workspaces with a remote backend** (like **S3 + DynamoDB**, **Azure Blob**, **GCS**, or **Terraform Cloud**) is a **very common real-world setup** for managing multiple environments safely.

Let’s go step-by-step. 👇

---

## 🌍 1. What Happens with Workspaces + Remote Backend

When you use **a remote backend**, Terraform automatically stores each workspace’s **state file separately** in that backend.

For example, with an **S3 backend**:

* Workspace: `default` → state stored as `terraform.tfstate`
* Workspace: `dev` → state stored as `env:/dev/terraform.tfstate`
* Workspace: `prod` → state stored as `env:/prod/terraform.tfstate`

So you get **isolated state files** for each environment automatically!

---

## ⚙️ 2. Example: S3 + DynamoDB Backend Setup

Here’s a complete example configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-states"
    key            = "global/s3/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "ap-south-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

> 💡 Note: Even though the key is `global/s3/terraform.tfstate`, Terraform will **automatically adjust it** per workspace (e.g., `env:/dev/global/s3/terraform.tfstate`).

---

## 🧩 3. Using Workspaces with Remote Backend

Once you have your backend configured:

```bash
# Initialize backend
terraform init

# Create a workspace for dev
terraform workspace new dev

# Create another workspace for prod
terraform workspace new prod

# List all workspaces
terraform workspace list

# Select a workspace
terraform workspace select dev

# Apply your infrastructure in that workspace
terraform apply
```

✅ Each workspace now uses a **different remote state file** in your S3 bucket (or whichever backend you configured).

---

## 🧠 4. Backend Folder Structure (S3 Example)

In your S3 bucket, you’ll see files like:

```
my-terraform-states/
├── env:/dev/global/s3/terraform.tfstate
├── env:/prod/global/s3/terraform.tfstate
└── global/s3/terraform.tfstate  (default)
```

This separation ensures `dev` and `prod` environments don’t overwrite each other’s state.

---

## 🧩 5. Example Variable Usage per Workspace

You can even make your resources dynamic using `terraform.workspace`:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-app-${terraform.workspace}"
}

output "bucket_name" {
  value = aws_s3_bucket.example.bucket
}
```

So:

* In `dev` workspace → creates `my-app-dev`
* In `prod` workspace → creates `my-app-prod`

---

## 🚫 Important Notes

| Note               | Description                                                                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔐 Locking         | Always use **DynamoDB** with S3 to prevent concurrent apply issues.                     |
| 🗂️ Variables      | You can use different `tfvars` files per workspace (e.g., `dev.tfvars`, `prod.tfvars`). |
| 🚀 Terraform Cloud | Terraform Cloud also automatically isolates state by workspace.                         |
| ⚠️ Workspace names | Avoid using workspace names with `/` (Terraform will use them as path separators).      |

---

## ✅ Recommended Workflow

```bash
terraform init

terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace select dev
terraform apply -var-file="dev.tfvars"

terraform workspace new prod
terraform workspace select prod
terraform apply -var-file="prod.tfvars"
```

This keeps your:

* same `.tf` code
* isolated states
* separate environment-specific variables
