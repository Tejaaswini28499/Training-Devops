Steps to Create AWS Credentials
Sign in to the AWS Management Console:

Go to the AWS Management Console.
Sign in with your AWS account credentials.
Navigate to IAM:

In the AWS Management Console, search for and select IAM (Identity and Access Management).
Create a New IAM User (if you donâ€™t already have one):

In the IAM dashboard, click on Users in the sidebar.
Click the Add users button.
Configure User Details:

User Name: Enter a username (e.g., github-actions-user).
Access Type: Select Programmatic access. This creates an AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY that are used to authenticate programmatically (e.g., through GitHub Actions).
Click Next: Permissions.
Set Permissions:

Attach existing policies directly: Choose a policy that provides the necessary permissions. Common options include:
AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess: Grants full access to Amazon ECR.
AdministratorAccess: Grants full access to all AWS services. (Use this with caution.)
Alternatively, create a custom policy that provides only the permissions you need.
Review and Create:

Review the user details and permissions.
Click Create user.
Download the Credentials:

After creating the user, you will see the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.
Download the .csv file containing these credentials, or copy the keys and store them securely. This is the only time you will see the AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. If you lose it, you will need to create new keys.
Store Credentials as GitHub Secrets:

Go to your GitHub repository.
Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions.
Add the following secrets:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: Your newly created access key ID.
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Your newly created secret access key.



Note: we are creating IAM AWS-Managed Policy premission only for "AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess" as we need only access to ECR
