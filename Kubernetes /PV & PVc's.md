persistent volumes: this are the storage we are taking from the storage backend storages like AWS elsticblock storage, NFS storage, Google clould and many we are just adding to machine and its independent of POD they are accessable to whole cluster we always use remote stoarge due to local violates some points. PV adding storage to cluster based on developer requriment is done by administrator. After all this the pod request the volume through pv claim. claim tries to find volume in cluster but actual volume is from the backend storage after finding the storage we need to mount into the container. Admin role creates a PV user role claims the PVC

**Persistent Volumes (PV):** These are storage resources provided by the underlying storage backend, such as AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS), Network File System (NFS), Google Cloud Persistent Disk, and others. Persistent Volumes are added to the Kubernetes cluster and are independent of Pods, meaning they can be accessed by the entire cluster. 

We often use remote storage for PVs because local storage can have limitations, such as data loss when a node fails or a Pod is rescheduled to a different node. Remote storage ensures data persistence across cluster nodes.

PV provisioning is done by an administrator who adds storage to the cluster based on developer requirements. After the PVs are created, a Pod requests storage through a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC). The PVC is a user's way of requesting storage resources without needing to know the details of the underlying storage infrastructure.

When a PVC is created, it tries to find a matching PV in the cluster. The actual storage, however, comes from the backend storage provider. Once a suitable PV is found, it is bound to the PVC, and the storage is made available for the Pod to mount into its container.

In summary:
- **Admin role:** Creates the Persistent Volumes (PV).
- **User role:** Claims the storage by creating a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), which Kubernetes then uses to find and bind a suitable PV.
