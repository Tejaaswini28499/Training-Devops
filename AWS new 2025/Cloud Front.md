Got it 👍 Let’s break down **Amazon CloudFront** in a **short, interview-friendly** way.

---

## 🌐 What is CloudFront?

* **CloudFront** is **AWS’s Content Delivery Network (CDN)**.
* It delivers **web content, APIs, videos, applications, and data** to users globally with **low latency** and **high transfer speed**.
* Works by caching content at **AWS Edge Locations** around the world.

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts

1. **Edge Locations**

   * Global data centers where content is cached.
   * Users connect to the nearest Edge → improves performance.

2. **Origin**

   * The source of your content.
   * Examples: **S3 bucket**, **EC2**, **ALB/ELB**, or even **non-AWS servers**.

3. **Distribution**

   * The configuration in CloudFront.
   * Two types:

     * **Web Distribution** → Websites, APIs, static/dynamic content.
     * **RTMP (deprecated)** → Old streaming method.

4. **Caching**

   * CloudFront caches objects in Edge locations.
   * Controlled using **TTL (Time to Live)** headers or custom cache policies.

5. **Security**

   * **HTTPS support** with ACM certificates.
   * **Signed URLs / Signed Cookies** → Restrict access to paid or private content.
   * **Geo Restriction** → Allow/Deny content by country.
   * Integrates with **AWS WAF & Shield** for protection.

6. **Performance**

   * **Anycast routing** → User requests automatically routed to the nearest edge.
   * Supports **Compression (Gzip/Brotli)**, **HTTP/2**, and **QUIC** for faster delivery.

---

## ⚡ Common Use Cases

* Serve **static website content** (S3 + CloudFront).
* Deliver **dynamic web apps / APIs** faster.
* **Video streaming** (live or on-demand).
* Protect and distribute **paid digital content**.
* Accelerate **software downloads** globally.

---

## 💡 Interview Questions

1. **What is CloudFront and why is it used?**
   → To speed up content delivery using edge locations, reduce latency, improve security.

2. **Difference between CloudFront and S3?**

   * S3 = storage, CloudFront = content delivery.
   * CloudFront sits in front of S3 to cache and accelerate.

3. **How does caching work in CloudFront?**

   * Based on TTL and cache behaviors. Can invalidate cache when content changes.

4. **How do you restrict content access?**

   * Signed URLs, Signed Cookies, Geo Restriction, IAM/Origin Access Control.

5. **CloudFront vs API Gateway?**

   * CloudFront → caching + global content delivery.
   * API Gateway → full API management (auth, rate limiting, etc.).

---

## 🚀 Benefits

* Low latency & high transfer speeds.
* Global coverage (400+ edge locations).
* Security with WAF, Shield, SSL/TLS.
* Scalability (auto handles high traffic).
* Cost-effective (pay as you go).

---

### 4️⃣ Security

* **HTTPS/TLS** with ACM certs.
* **Origin Access Control (OAC)** → Secure CloudFront ↔ S3 connection.
* **Signed URLs / Signed Cookies** → Restrict paid/private content.
* **Geo Restriction** → Block/allow countries.
* **Integrates with WAF & Shield** → DDoS and app protection.

---

### 5️⃣ Performance Features

* **Anycast routing** → User request goes to nearest edge.
* **Compression** → Gzip & Brotli.
* **Protocols** → HTTP/2, HTTP/3 (QUIC).
* **Lambda\@Edge / CloudFront Functions** → Run custom code at edge for redirects, authentication, header rewrites.

---

### 6️⃣ Monitoring & Logging

* **CloudWatch Metrics** → Requests, errors, latency.
* **Standard/Real-time logs** → Store in S3.
* **Usage reports** → Bandwidth, cache hit ratio.

---

### 7️⃣ Pricing Model

* Pay for:

  * **Data transfer out** (cheaper from cache vs origin).
  * **HTTP/HTTPS requests**.
  * **Invalidations beyond 1,000 paths/month**.
* **No upfront fees** → Pay as you go.

---

### 8️⃣ Integrations

* **S3 + CloudFront** → Static website hosting with CDN.
* **EC2 / ALB** → Dynamic web apps.

# 🌐 AWS Content Delivery Network (CDN)

### 1️⃣ What is a CDN?

* A **CDN** is a network of **servers distributed globally** that cache and deliver content (web pages, images, videos, APIs, downloads) to users.
* Goal → Deliver content **faster**, with **low latency** and **high availability**.

---

### 2️⃣ AWS’s CDN → **Amazon CloudFront**

* **Amazon CloudFront** is AWS’s CDN service.
* It uses **edge locations** worldwide to cache data close to end-users.
* Reduces the distance between **user** and **origin server** (like S3, EC2, ALB, or external servers).

---

### 3️⃣ How it Works

1. User requests content (e.g., `www.example.com/image.jpg`).
2. Request goes to nearest **Edge Location**.

   * If cached → returned immediately (**low latency**).
   * If not cached → fetched from **origin**, cached at edge, then returned.
3. Next user nearby gets the cached copy instantly.

---

### 4️⃣ Key Features of AWS CDN (CloudFront)

* **Global Edge Locations** → 400+ worldwide.
* **Caching & TTL** → Store frequently used content close to users.
* **Security**

  * HTTPS/TLS encryption.
  * Integration with **AWS WAF & Shield**.
  * **Signed URLs / Signed Cookies** for private content.
* **Performance**

  * Anycast routing (nearest edge).
  * HTTP/2, HTTP/3 (QUIC), Brotli/Gzip compression.
* **Custom Logic** → **Lambda\@Edge / CloudFront Functions**.

---

### 5️⃣ Benefits of AWS CDN

* **Low latency** → Faster response to global users.
* **Scalability** → Handles sudden traffic spikes (e.g., live events, viral content).
* **Security** → DDoS protection, SSL, WAF.
* **Cost-effective** → Reduces load on origin servers.
* **High availability** → Uses AWS’s global infrastructure.

---

### 6️⃣ Common Use Cases

* Hosting **static websites** (S3 + CloudFront).
* Accelerating **APIs** & dynamic web apps.
* **Video streaming** (live & on-demand).
* Distributing **software downloads** globally.
* Protecting & delivering **premium/paid content**.

### 7️⃣ Interview Questions

1. **What is a CDN? Why do we use it?**
   → Distributed network to cache and deliver content faster, reduce latency, and improve performance.

2. **What is AWS’s CDN service?**
   → Amazon CloudFront.

3. **How does CloudFront reduce latency?**
   → By caching content at edge locations close to the user.

4. **What are some security features of CloudFront?**
   → HTTPS, signed URLs/cookies, geo-restrictions, AWS WAF & Shield.

---

👉 In short:
**AWS CDN = Amazon CloudFront → a global service that caches and delivers content at edge locations for faster, more secure, and scalable content delivery.**
