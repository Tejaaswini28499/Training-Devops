## üîê **Security & Access Control**

8. **How do you secure access to an S3 bucket?**

   * IAM Policies
   * Bucket Policies
   * ACLs (Access Control Lists)
   * S3 Block Public Access settings

9. **Difference between IAM policy and Bucket policy?**

   * IAM policy ‚Üí Attaches to users/roles.
   * Bucket policy ‚Üí Attaches directly to the bucket and controls access to it.

10. **What are S3 Block Public Access settings?**
    ‚Üí Global settings to prevent accidental public exposure of buckets.

11. **How can you encrypt data in S3?**

* **Server-Side Encryption (SSE):**

  * SSE-S3 (Managed by S3)
  * SSE-KMS (Managed by KMS)
  * SSE-C (Customer-provided key)
* **Client-Side Encryption**

12. **How can you restrict access to a specific IP range?**
    ‚Üí Use **bucket policy** with `"Condition": {"IpAddress": {"aws:SourceIp": "IP_RANGE"}}`

13. **How do you enforce HTTPS access only?**
    ‚Üí Bucket policy condition using `"aws:SecureTransport": "true"`

## üß∞ **Performance, Versioning & Lifecycle**

14. **What is Versioning in S3?**
    ‚Üí Keeps multiple versions of an object to recover from accidental deletes or overwrites.

15. **What happens when versioning is suspended?**
    ‚Üí New uploads get a `null` version ID; old versions remain.

16. **What is S3 Lifecycle Policy?**
    ‚Üí Automates transitions between storage classes or deletion after a defined period.

17. **What is S3 Replication?**

    * **Cross-Region Replication (CRR)** ‚Üí replicate objects to another region.
    * **Same-Region Replication (SRR)** ‚Üí replicate within same region.

18. **Does S3 replication copy existing objects?**
    ‚Üí No, only new or updated objects after replication is enabled.

19. **What is S3 Transfer Acceleration?**
    ‚Üí Speeds up uploads using Amazon CloudFront‚Äôs globally distributed edge locations.

20. **What is S3 Select and Glacier Select?**
    ‚Üí Lets you query a subset of data using SQL-like syntax, improving performance.

    ‚Üí Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or AWS CLI commands in pipelines.

22. **How do you monitor S3 usage and activity?**

    * AWS CloudWatch Metrics (for storage, requests)
    * AWS CloudTrail (for API activity)
    * S3 Access Logs

23. **How do you audit who accessed what in S3?**
    ‚Üí Enable CloudTrail data events for S3.

24. **How do you handle accidental deletion?**

    * Enable Versioning
    * Use MFA Delete
    * Restrict `s3:DeleteObject` permissions

25. **How do you restrict users from deleting buckets?**
    ‚Üí Deny `s3:DeleteBucket` in IAM policy.

26. **How can you make an S3 bucket act as a static website?**

    * Enable ‚ÄúStatic Website Hosting‚Äù in S3 properties.
    * Provide index.html and error.html files.
    * Use Route 53 alias or CloudFront for custom domain and HTTPS.

27. **How do you restrict S3 access from only a VPC or EC2 instance?**
    ‚Üí Use **VPC Endpoint Policies** and **bucket policy** with `"aws:SourceVpc"` condition.

28. **What are S3 Event Notifications?**
    ‚Üí Automatically trigger Lambda, SNS, or SQS on events like `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.

29. **How do you integrate S3 with CloudFront?**
    ‚Üí CloudFront acts as a CDN with S3 as the origin; improves performance and security.

30. **How do you handle cross-account S3 access?**

    * Bucket policy allowing other account‚Äôs IAM role/user
    * Or use AWS STS AssumeRole for temporary access

## ‚òÅÔ∏è **Real-World Scenario Questions**

31. Your team accidentally deleted production data in S3. How do you recover it?
    ‚Üí Restore from versioning / backup / Glacier if lifecycle rules are in place.

32. You need to move data from one account‚Äôs S3 bucket to another automatically. How?
    ‚Üí Use **Cross-Account Replication** with proper IAM roles and bucket policies.

33. You want to store large log files for compliance for 7 years at minimum cost. Which storage class?
    ‚Üí **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**

34. How do you identify publicly accessible buckets across your organization?
    ‚Üí Use **AWS Trusted Advisor** or **AWS Config rules** (like `s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited`).

35. A build pipeline fails due to "AccessDenied" while uploading artifacts to S3 ‚Äî what‚Äôs your approach?

* Check IAM role attached to the build agent.
* Verify S3 bucket policy and KMS key permissions.
* Ensure correct region and encryption settings.

## üß† **Bonus Interview Tip**

üëâ In **DevOps interviews**, focus on:

* S3 integration in **CI/CD pipelines** (for artifacts, logs, or Terraform state).
* **Security & IAM roles**.
* **Cross-account access**, **backup**, and **automation** via scripts or IaC.
