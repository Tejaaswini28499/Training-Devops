Okay üôÇ let‚Äôs keep it simple:

**AWS Lambda** is a **serverless compute service** from Amazon.
That means you don‚Äôt need to create or manage servers. You just write your code, upload it, and AWS runs it for you **only when needed**.

üëâ **Key points (brief):**

* **Event-driven**: Lambda runs your code when something happens (e.g., file uploaded to S3, API Gateway request, DynamoDB change, CloudWatch event).
* **Pay-per-use**: You pay only for the execution time and resources used, not for idle servers.
* **Languages supported**: Python, Node.js, Java, Go, .NET, Ruby, etc.
* **Scales automatically**: If 1 user calls it or 1 million users call it, Lambda handles the scaling.
* **Stateless**: Each function run is independent, no saved state between runs (unless you use external storage like S3 or DynamoDB).

üëâ **Example**:
Imagine you upload a photo to an S3 bucket. A Lambda function can be triggered to automatically resize the image and save it back to another bucket.

Would you like me to also explain **how it is different from EC2** (so it‚Äôs clearer)?
Got it üëç Here are some **AWS Lambda scenario-based interview questions** (the kind they usually ask in interviews, not just definitions):

---

### üîπ Basic Scenarios

1. **Scenario:** Your team wants to run a small script whenever a file is uploaded to S3. How would you design it with Lambda?
   üëâ Expected Answer: Configure **S3 event notification** ‚Üí trigger Lambda ‚Üí process the file (e.g., resize image, validate, transform data).

2. **Scenario:** You have an API built using API Gateway + Lambda. A user complains of high latency. How do you troubleshoot?
   üëâ Expected Answer:

   * Check **CloudWatch Logs** for Lambda execution time.
   * Verify **cold starts** (function not invoked for a while ‚Üí longer start time).
   * Increase **memory/timeout settings**.
   * Use **provisioned concurrency** to reduce cold starts.
   * Optimize code (e.g., DB connections, package size).

3. **Scenario:** A Lambda function processes messages from an SQS queue, but some messages are failing. How do you handle this?
   üëâ Expected Answer: Configure a **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** (SQS or SNS) so failed messages go there. Investigate and reprocess later.

---

### üîπ Advanced Scenarios

4. **Scenario:** You have a Lambda that queries a database (RDS). During peak hours, DB connections are getting exhausted. What will you do?
   üëâ Expected Answer:

   * Use **RDS Proxy** to manage DB connections.
   * Reuse connections (don‚Äôt open new ones every invocation).
   * Consider DynamoDB if suitable.

5. **Scenario:** Lambda is failing because the deployment package is too large (exceeds limit). What‚Äôs your solution?
   üëâ Expected Answer:

   * Use **Lambda Layers** to separate dependencies.
   * Store large code/artifacts in **S3 + EFS** and mount to Lambda.

6. **Scenario:** Your Lambda is processing millions of events but costs are going very high. How would you optimize cost?
   üëâ Expected Answer:

   * Reduce function execution time (optimize code).
   * Right-size memory (more memory can finish faster, less billed time).
   * Batch processing from SQS/Kinesis instead of per-message invocation.
   * Consider Step Functions for orchestration.

---

### üîπ Security Scenarios

7. **Scenario:** A developer gave Lambda full admin IAM role to access AWS services. What‚Äôs wrong here?
   üëâ Expected Answer: Use **least privilege IAM roles** ‚Üí Lambda should only have permissions it needs.

8. **Scenario:** You need to store database credentials securely for Lambda. How do you do it?
   üëâ Expected Answer: Store credentials in **AWS Secrets Manager** or **SSM Parameter Store (with KMS encryption)** and retrieve at runtime.

---

‚ö° Pro Tip: In interviews, they don‚Äôt just check ‚Äúwhat Lambda is,‚Äù but **how you use it in real-world problems (scalability, performance, security, cost optimization).**

Do you want me to also give you a **short list of common mistakes with Lambda** (these are often asked as trick questions)?
Perfect üëç Here‚Äôs a **list of common mistakes with AWS Lambda** that interviewers love to test as trick or scenario questions:

---

### üîπ **Common Mistakes & Interview Traps**

1. **Cold Starts Ignored**

   * Mistake: Not considering latency when Lambda is idle for a while (cold start).
   * Fix: Use **Provisioned Concurrency** for critical APIs.

2. **Not Reusing Connections**

   * Mistake: Opening a new DB connection on every invocation ‚Üí DB gets overloaded.
   * Fix: Reuse connections (define outside the handler) or use **RDS Proxy**.

3. **Over-Provisioning or Under-Provisioning Memory**

   * Mistake: Giving too little memory (slower, more billed time) or too much (expensive).
   * Fix: Use the **AWS Lambda Power Tuning tool** to find the right balance.

4. **Large Deployment Package**

   * Mistake: Putting all libraries in one big zip (exceeds limits, slow deploy).
   * Fix: Use **Lambda Layers** or **EFS mount** for dependencies.

5. **Hardcoding Secrets/Config**

   * Mistake: Writing DB passwords or API keys in code.
   * Fix: Use **AWS Secrets Manager** or **SSM Parameter Store**.

6. **Ignoring Retry Behavior**

   * Mistake: Not realizing that failed Lambda invocations (from SQS/Kinesis) **auto-retry** and can cause duplicate processing.
   * Fix: Implement **idempotency** (same event processed once) + use **DLQ**.

7. **Timeout Misconfiguration**

   * Mistake: Keeping Lambda timeout too short (fails before finishing) or too long (wastes money).
   * Fix: Set proper timeout; for long workflows use **Step Functions** instead.

8. **Running Heavy Tasks Inside Lambda**

   * Mistake: Using Lambda for long-running jobs (video processing, ML training).
   * Fix: Use **ECS/Fargate/Batch** for heavy compute tasks.

9. **Not Monitoring Properly**

   * Mistake: No visibility into errors, performance, or costs.
   * Fix: Use **CloudWatch Logs, X-Ray, Metrics, and Alarms**.

10. **IAM Over-Permissions**

* Mistake: Giving Lambda `AdministratorAccess`.
* Fix: Apply **least privilege principle** ‚Üí only allow needed actions.

---

‚úÖ **Why this matters in interviews**:
They often ask: *‚ÄúYou built a Lambda function, but it‚Äôs failing/slow/expensive. What could be wrong?‚Äù* ‚Üí These mistakes are the hidden answers.

Do you want me to prepare a **mock interview Q\&A** where I play the interviewer and you try answering these Lambda scenario questions? That will feel like a real interview practice.
Great question üëå this comes up often in interviews because **Lambda + Step Functions** is one of the most powerful AWS serverless combos. Let me break it down simply:

---

## üîπ **How AWS Lambda and Step Functions Work Together**

* **AWS Lambda** ‚Üí Runs your **code** (short tasks, like resize an image, validate input, call an API).
* **AWS Step Functions** ‚Üí Orchestrates (like a manager) multiple tasks into a **workflow** with decisions, retries, and sequences.

üëâ You can think of it like this:

* **Lambda** = Worker (does the job).
* **Step Functions** = Boss (decides what order, what happens if it fails, when to retry).

---

## üîπ Example Workflow

Imagine you have an **order processing system**:

1. **Receive Order** (Step Function starts)
2. Call Lambda ‚Üí **Validate Order**
3. If valid ‚Üí Call Lambda ‚Üí **Charge Payment**

   * If payment fails ‚Üí Retry 3 times ‚Üí Else ‚Üí Fail workflow.
4. Call Lambda ‚Üí **Update Inventory**
5. Call Lambda ‚Üí **Send Confirmation Email**
6. End

üìå Here, **Step Functions controls the flow**, while **Lambdas handle each step**.

---

## üîπ Why Use Them Together?

1. **Error Handling & Retries** ‚Äì Step Functions can automatically retry failed Lambdas.
2. **State Tracking** ‚Äì Step Functions keep track of progress (what succeeded/failed).
3. **Long Workflows** ‚Äì Lambda alone times out at max 15 mins. Step Functions can run workflows for **days, weeks, or even a year**.
4. **Branching Logic** ‚Äì Step Functions can make decisions (`if order > 10 items ‚Üí send to approval`, else process directly).
5. **Cost Efficient** ‚Äì You only pay for Lambda execution + Step Functions state transitions.

---

## üîπ Real-World Use Case

* **ETL Pipeline**

  * Step Functions trigger Lambda to **Extract** data from API
  * Next Lambda **Transform** data (clean, validate)
  * Next Lambda **Load** into DynamoDB/S3
  * If failure ‚Üí Step Function sends alert via SNS

---

‚úÖ **Interview Tip**:
If asked *‚ÄúWhy not just one big Lambda instead of Step Functions?‚Äù*
üëâ Answer:

* A single Lambda becomes hard to manage/debug.
* Step Functions let you break into smaller, reusable Lambdas.
* They give monitoring, retries, and visual workflow in AWS Console.

---

Would you like me to also create a **step-by-step interview scenario** (with example JSON workflow definition for Step Functions) so you can explain with confidence?
--------
My Understaning: 

Lambda is a serverless compute service and you need not manage the severs its not running everytime it would only run if actions like S3 file upload, API Gateway request or for the other things which are configured 
its a pay as you use model and language supported is Python, Node and others, stateless as each and every lambda are independent of each other its scaleable if you get one request or million request it would handle
Monitoring: add cloud watch or Alarms to get the alerts 

Disadvantages: cold start: as lambda is on and off the 1st request when the lambda is on it would take few seconds to process so to overcome this we can have provision concurrency which means there will be some Lambda instances for which you need to pay and will be available all the time so always the request willnot be having delay this can be used if there are latency issue.

Retrying Lambda: retrying manytimes may have many request to process

connection to DB services : Multiple connection can cost very high (whenever the lambda is on and off you need to connect to lambda again and again so it would cost more)

over and under Provisioning: where you allocate more memory for less request and visaversa

Large deployment package: where lambda cant handle this but you can take help of s3 and EFS to mount the data 

Timeout misconfig: where you configure only 5 min for request to process in real its taking 10 min

----------------------------
Can Lambda be triggered by multiple sources simultaneously?
Yes, a Lambda function can be triggered by multiple sources. Each event source can invoke the same function independently, and Lambda automatically scales to handle concurrent invocations from different sources.‚Äù

------------------------------
Explain the Lambda execution environment.
Here‚Äôs a **simple interview-friendly answer** üëá

---

**AWS Lambda Execution Environment** is the **isolated container** where your Lambda function runs.
It includes the **runtime (like Python or Node.js)**, your **function code**, **temporary storage (/tmp)**, and **environment variables**.

When Lambda is invoked:

1. AWS **creates the environment** and loads your code ‚Äî this is called a **cold start**.
2. Next time, it may **reuse the same environment** ‚Äî called a **warm start**, which is faster.
3. If idle for a while, AWS **stops (freezes)** the environment.

Each environment is **secure and isolated**, and runs with the **IAM role** you assign.

---------------------

Explain event object in Lambda ‚Äî give an example for S3 or API Gateway.
‚úÖ **Event object in AWS Lambda**

The **event object** is the **input data** passed to your Lambda function when it‚Äôs triggered.
It contains details about *what triggered the function* and *the data associated with that event.*

---

### üîπ Example 1: **S3 Trigger Event**

When an S3 bucket triggers a Lambda (for example, when a file is uploaded), the event object looks like this:

```json
{
  "Records": [
    {
      "eventVersion": "2.1",
      "eventSource": "aws:s3",
      "awsRegion": "us-east-1",
      "eventTime": "2025-10-18T12:00:00.000Z",
      "eventName": "ObjectCreated:Put",
      "s3": {
        "bucket": {
          "name": "my-upload-bucket"
        },
        "object": {
          "key": "images/photo.jpg",
          "size": 2048
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

üìò **Explanation:**

* `eventSource`: tells Lambda this came from S3
* `eventName`: describes what happened (`ObjectCreated:Put`)
* `bucket.name`: name of the S3 bucket
* `object.key`: file name uploaded
* `object.size`: size in bytes

üëâ You can use this in your Lambda code like:

```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']
    print(f"New file uploaded: {key} in bucket: {bucket}")
```

---

### üîπ Example 2: **API Gateway Trigger Event**

When an API Gateway HTTP request triggers Lambda, the event looks like this:

```json
{
  "resource": "/users",
  "path": "/users",
  "httpMethod": "POST",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "queryStringParameters": {
    "userId": "123"
  },
  "body": "{\"name\": \"Teja\", \"role\": \"DevOps\"}",
  "isBase64Encoded": false
}
```

üìò **Explanation:**

* `httpMethod`: GET, POST, etc.
* `path`: which resource path was called
* `queryStringParameters`: URL parameters
* `body`: request payload (usually in JSON)

üëâ Example code:

```python
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    body = json.loads(event['body'])
    name = body['name']
    print(f"Received POST request for user: {name}")
    return {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "body": json.dumps({"message": f"Hello, {name}!"})
    }
```

---

### üí° Interview Answer:

> The **event object** in Lambda contains the input data that triggered the function.
> Its structure depends on the event source ‚Äî for example, an S3 event includes bucket and object details, while an API Gateway event includes HTTP request data like method, path, headers, and body.

---
What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous invocation
‚úÖ **Difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous Invocation in AWS Lambda**

Lambda functions can be invoked in **two main ways** ‚Äî **synchronously** or **asynchronously** ‚Äî depending on how the event source interacts with the function.

---

### üîπ **1. Synchronous Invocation**

* The **caller waits** for the function to finish.
* The **response (output)** is returned to the caller immediately.
* Used when you **need the result right away**.

üìò **Examples:**

* API Gateway ‚Üí Lambda (returns an HTTP response)
* AWS SDK / CLI direct call (e.g., `aws lambda invoke`)
* ALB (Application Load Balancer) invoking Lambda

üìú **Flow:**

```
Caller ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí Waits for result ‚Üí Gets response
```

‚úÖ **Characteristics:**

| Feature  | Description                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Response | Caller gets result immediately         |
| Retry    | Caller must retry manually if it fails |
| Use Case | Request/response-based systems         |
| Examples | API Gateway, SDK calls, ALB            |

üß† **Example:**
When API Gateway triggers Lambda to process a login request ‚Äî the user waits until Lambda returns the result (‚ÄúLogin successful‚Äù).

---

### üîπ **2. Asynchronous Invocation**

* The **caller doesn‚Äôt wait** for Lambda to finish.
* The event is **queued** and Lambda processes it **in the background**.
* Used when you **don‚Äôt need an immediate response**.

üìò **Examples:**

* S3 (on file upload)
* SNS
* EventBridge / CloudWatch Events

üìú **Flow:**

```
Caller ‚Üí Lambda (event queued) ‚Üí Caller moves on ‚Üí Lambda runs later
```

‚úÖ **Characteristics:**

| Feature  | Description                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Response | No response to caller                              |
| Retry    | Lambda automatically retries on failure (twice)    |
| Use Case | Background or decoupled processing                 |
| Examples | S3 triggers, SNS notifications, EventBridge events |

üß† **Example:**
When an image is uploaded to S3, the upload completes immediately, and S3 asynchronously triggers a Lambda to process or resize the image.

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Summary Table**

| Feature               | **Synchronous Invocation** | **Asynchronous Invocation**   |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Caller waits?         | Yes                        | No                            |
| Response              | Immediate                  | None                          |
| Retry                 | Caller handles             | Lambda auto-retries (2 times) |
| Event Source Examples | API Gateway, ALB, CLI      | S3, SNS, EventBridge          |
| Best for              | Request/response           | Background jobs               |

---

üí¨ **Interview Answer:**

> In synchronous invocation, the caller waits for Lambda to finish and gets a response (like API Gateway calls).
> In asynchronous invocation, the caller just sends the event, and Lambda processes it later in the background (like S3 or SNS triggers).

---
How do you assign permissions to a Lambda function?
‚úÖ **Assigning Permissions to an AWS Lambda Function**

AWS Lambda **needs permissions** to access other AWS services (like S3, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, etc.).
These permissions are controlled using **IAM roles and policies**.

---

### üîπ **1. Execution Role (IAM Role)**

Every Lambda function has an **Execution Role** ‚Äî also called the **Lambda function role**.
This role defines **what the Lambda is allowed to do** inside AWS.

üìò Example:
If your Lambda reads from S3 and writes to DynamoDB, the role needs:

* `s3:GetObject` permission
* `dynamodb:PutItem` permission

---

### üîπ **How to Assign Permissions**

You can assign permissions in **three main ways:**

#### **(A) While Creating the Function**

* In AWS Console ‚Üí **Create Function ‚Üí Permissions section**
* Choose:

  * ‚úÖ ‚ÄúCreate a new role with basic Lambda permissions‚Äù (includes CloudWatch Logs)
  * OR
  * ‚úÖ ‚ÄúUse an existing role‚Äù (attach a custom IAM role)

#### **(B) Modify the Role Later**

* Go to **IAM ‚Üí Roles ‚Üí [Your Lambda Role] ‚Üí Add Permissions ‚Üí Attach Policy**
* Example policies:

  * `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` ‚Üí for writing logs
  * `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` ‚Üí to read from S3

#### **(C) Using AWS CLI / IaC**

Example (CLI):

```bash
aws lambda create-function \
  --function-name MyLambda \
  --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyLambdaRole \
  --runtime python3.9 \
  --handler lambda_function.lambda_handler \
  --zip-file fileb://function.zip
```

---

### üîπ **2. Resource-Based Policies**

Sometimes, *other AWS services* (like S3, SNS, or EventBridge) need permission to **invoke** your Lambda.
This is controlled using a **resource-based policy** attached directly to the Lambda.

üìò Example ‚Äî Allow S3 to trigger your Lambda:

```bash
aws lambda add-permission \
  --function-name MyLambda \
  --action "lambda:InvokeFunction" \
  --principal s3.amazonaws.com \
  --source-arn arn:aws:s3:::my-upload-bucket \
  --statement-id s3invoke
```

This adds a **resource-based policy** allowing S3 to invoke the Lambda function.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **In Summary**

| Type of Permission  | Used For                | Example                                |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Execution Role**  | What Lambda *can do*    | Read from S3, Write to DynamoDB        |
| **Resource Policy** | Who *can invoke Lambda* | Allow S3/SNS/EventBridge to trigger it |

---

### üí¨ **Interview Answer:**

> Lambda permissions are controlled using IAM roles and policies.
> The **execution role** gives Lambda permission to access AWS services, while **resource-based policies** allow other services (like S3 or SNS) to invoke the function.
> You attach the execution role when creating or updating the function.

---
Can Lambda access resources in a VPC? How?
‚úÖ **Yes, AWS Lambda can access resources inside a VPC** ‚Äî but you must **configure it explicitly.**

By default, Lambda runs **outside your VPC** in an AWS-managed network.
To access private resources like **RDS, EC2, or ElastiCache**, you must **connect your Lambda to the VPC.**

---

### üîπ **Why Connect Lambda to a VPC?**

Because:

* RDS, EC2, or Redis instances are often in **private subnets** (no public internet access).
* So Lambda needs to run *inside the same VPC* to reach them.

---

### üîπ **How It Works**

When you attach your Lambda to a VPC:

1. You specify:

   * **VPC ID**
   * **Subnet IDs** (usually *private* subnets)
   * **Security Group IDs**
2. AWS creates **Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)** in those subnets.
3. Lambda function then uses those ENIs to communicate with your private resources.

---

### üîπ **Steps to Configure Lambda for VPC Access**

#### üß≠ **Option 1: AWS Console**

1. Open your Lambda function.
2. Go to **Configuration ‚Üí Environment ‚Üí VPC.**
3. Choose:

   * **VPC:** Your VPC ID
   * **Subnets:** Private subnets (where your resources live)
   * **Security Group:** One that allows outbound access to the target (like RDS)
4. Save ‚Üí Lambda will redeploy with new ENIs.

---

#### üß∞ **Option 2: Using CLI**

```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name MyLambda \
  --vpc-config SubnetIds=subnet-12345,subnet-67890,SecurityGroupIds=sg-abcde
```

---

### üîπ **Example Scenario**

You have:

* RDS MySQL inside private subnet.
* Lambda function `DataProcessor` needs to query RDS.

‚úÖ Solution:

* Attach Lambda to the **same VPC and private subnet**.
* Ensure **Security Group** rules:

  * Lambda SG ‚Üí outbound to RDS SG (port 3306)
  * RDS SG ‚Üí inbound from Lambda SG (port 3306)

Now Lambda can securely connect to the database.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

| Point                             | Explanation                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No Internet Access by Default** | Once inside a private subnet, Lambda loses internet access unless NAT Gateway is configured. |
| **Cold Start Impact**             | ENI creation can increase startup time (slightly slower cold starts).                        |
| **Best Practice**                 | Use minimal subnets & least-privilege security groups to improve performance.                |

---

### üí¨ **Interview Answer:**

> Yes, Lambda can access resources in a VPC.
> You configure it with the VPC ID, subnets, and security groups.
> AWS creates ENIs in those subnets, allowing the function to securely communicate with private resources like RDS or EC2.
> If it‚Äôs in a private subnet, you need a NAT Gateway for internet access.

What are the different ways to trigger a Lambda function?
Lambda can be triggered in many ways ‚Äî by AWS services like S3, API Gateway, SNS, SQS, EventBridge, DynamoDB Streams, or manually using the console, CLI, or SDK.
It supports synchronous, asynchronous, and stream-based invocations depending on the source.

-----------------------------
How do you handle errors and retries in Lambda?
‚úÖ **Handling Errors and Retries in AWS Lambda**

When a Lambda function fails, how the error is handled depends on **how it was invoked** ‚Äî **synchronously**, **asynchronously**, or via **stream-based sources** (like SQS or Kinesis).

Let‚Äôs go step by step üëá

---

### üîπ **1. Synchronous Invocations**

üü¢ **Examples:** API Gateway, CLI, SDK, ALB

* The **caller gets the error response directly**.
* Lambda **does not automatically retry**.
* The **caller is responsible** for retrying.

üìò **Example:**
If API Gateway calls Lambda and it throws an exception:

```json
{
  "errorMessage": "Database connection failed",
  "errorType": "RuntimeError"
}
```

‚Üí API Gateway gets this error immediately.
‚Üí You can handle it in the **application code** or **retry logic** on the client side.

---

### üîπ **2. Asynchronous Invocations**

üü° **Examples:** S3, SNS, EventBridge

* Lambda automatically **queues the event** and **retries twice** on failure.
* Retry happens after:

  * **1st retry:** after 1 minute
  * **2nd retry:** after 2 minutes

If it still fails after 3 attempts (1 original + 2 retries),
the event can go to a **Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ)** or **on-failure destination**.

üìò **How to handle:**

* Use **DLQ (SQS or SNS)** ‚Üí store failed events for debugging.
* Or use **Event Destinations** for success/failure tracking.

Example DLQ setup (in Lambda config):

```bash
DeadLetterConfig:
  TargetArn: arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:123456789012:lambda-failures
```

---

### üîπ **3. Stream-based Invocations**

üü£ **Examples:** DynamoDB Streams, Kinesis, SQS

* Lambda **polls** data streams and **retries automatically** until the record is successfully processed or it expires.
* If messages continuously fail, they **block processing of newer records** in the same batch (because order must be preserved).

üìò **How to handle:**

* Use **error handling options**:

  * **Maximum retry attempts**
  * **Bisect batch on error** (split batch to isolate bad record)
  * **Destination** for failed records (SQS or SNS)

Example (for SQS trigger):

```yaml
MaximumRetryAttempts: 3
BisectBatchOnFunctionError: true
DestinationConfig:
  OnFailure:
    Destination: arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:123456789012:failed-messages
```

---

### üîπ **4. Inside Your Lambda Code**

You can also **catch and handle errors** programmatically:

```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    try:
        # your logic
        process_data(event)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
        # optionally send to SNS or log it
        raise e  # rethrow to trigger retry
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Summary Table**

| Invocation Type  | Retry Behavior                      | Error Handling Options          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Synchronous**  | Caller retries manually             | Handle in code or client        |
| **Asynchronous** | Lambda retries twice                | DLQ / Event Destinations        |
| **Stream-based** | Retries until success or expiration | Bisect batch, DLQ, Destinations |

### üí¨ **Interview Answer (concise):**

> Lambda error handling depends on the invocation type.
> For synchronous invocations, the caller handles retries.
> For asynchronous ones (like S3 or SNS), Lambda automatically retries twice and can send failed events to a Dead-Letter Queue.
> For stream-based sources like SQS or Kinesis, Lambda keeps retrying until success or record expiration.

How do you schedule Lambda functions using CloudWatch Events
You can schedule a Lambda function using CloudWatch Events or EventBridge by creating a rule with a rate or cron expression.
The rule triggers the Lambda automatically on schedule, similar to a cron job.
It‚Äôs often used for automation tasks like backups or report generation.

-------------------------
How do you optimize Lambda cold start times?
Cold starts occur when Lambda spins up a new execution environment.
To reduce them, you can minimize package size and dependencies, keep initialization lightweight, use provisioned concurrency, optimize VPC setup, and optionally schedule warm-up invocations.

-----------------------------
Difference between provisioned concurrency and normal Lambda execution.
Normal Lambda executes on-demand and may experience cold starts.
Provisioned Concurrency keeps pre-initialized instances ready, eliminating cold starts and providing predictable low latency, but incurs extra cost.

------------------------------------
Explain Lambda timeouts, memory allocation, and execution limits.
‚úÖ **AWS Lambda Timeouts, Memory Allocation, and Execution Limits**

AWS Lambda has configurable **resource and execution limits** that affect performance, cost, and reliability. Understanding these is crucial for designing Lambda functions efficiently.

---

## üîπ 1. **Timeouts**

* **Definition:** Maximum duration a Lambda function can run before AWS forcibly terminates it.
* **Configurable Range:** 1 second to **15 minutes (900 seconds)**.
* **Default:** 3 seconds.

üìò **Key Points:**

* Functions running longer than the timeout are **terminated** and marked as **failed**.
* Proper timeout prevents **hung functions** and unexpected costs.

üí° **Best Practice:**

* Set timeout slightly above the expected runtime.
* For functions triggered by **asynchronous events**, ensure the timeout accommodates **retries** and **external API calls**.

---

## üîπ 2. **Memory Allocation**

* **Range:** 128 MB to **10,240 MB (10 GB)**
* **Default:** 128 MB
* **Impact:** Lambda **CPU and network bandwidth scale linearly** with memory.

  * Higher memory ‚Üí more CPU ‚Üí faster execution.
* Cost is based on **memory allocated √ó execution duration**.

üìò **Example:**

* 512 MB function taking 1 second ‚Üí cheaper but slower than
* 2048 MB function taking 0.3 seconds ‚Üí may cost slightly more but much faster

üí° **Best Practice:**

* Test with different memory settings for optimal **cost vs performance**.

## üîπ 3. **Execution Limits**

| Limit                        | Details                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Maximum payload size**     | 6 MB (synchronous) / 256 KB (asynchronous) for event input         |
| **Ephemeral storage (/tmp)** | 512 MB (configurable up to 10 GB in new runtimes)                  |
| **Deployment package size**  | 50 MB (zip) / 250 MB (uncompressed, including layers)              |
| **Concurrent executions**    | Default 1000 per region per account (can be increased via request) |
| **Invocation frequency**     | No hard limit, but subject to concurrency & throttling             |
| **Environment variables**    | Up to 4 KB per function                                            |

---

### üîπ **Interrelation Between Memory & CPU**

* Lambda CPU is **proportional to memory**.
* Increasing memory often **reduces execution duration**, which can **reduce overall cost** even if memory allocation is higher.

üìò **Example:**

| Memory  | Duration | Cost per 1000 invocations |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| 512 MB  | 1000 ms  | $0.00001667               |
| 1024 MB | 500 ms   | $0.00001667               |

> Higher memory, lower duration ‚Üí same cost but faster execution

---

### üîπ **Best Practices**

1. Set **timeout** slightly above max expected execution.
2. Tune **memory** to balance speed vs cost.
3. Monitor **function metrics** (duration, memory usage) in CloudWatch.
4. Avoid exceeding **concurrent execution limits** to prevent throttling.

---

### üí¨ **Interview Answer (Concise):**

> Lambda functions have a **timeout** (1s‚Äì15min) to prevent runaway executions, **memory allocation** (128 MB‚Äì10 GB) which also scales CPU and affects cost, and **execution limits** like payload size, ephemeral storage, and concurrency.
> Properly tuning memory and timeout ensures cost-effective, reliable, and performant Lambda functions.

---
How do you handle large payloads in Lambda?
Lambda has payload size limits (6 MB sync, 256 KB async). For large payloads, store the data in S3 and pass only the object key to Lambda.
You can also use streaming, chunking, or pre-signed URLs to handle large files efficiently without exceeding Lambda limits.
