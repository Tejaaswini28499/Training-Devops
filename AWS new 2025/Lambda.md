Okay ðŸ™‚ letâ€™s keep it simple:

**AWS Lambda** is a **serverless compute service** from Amazon.
That means you donâ€™t need to create or manage servers. You just write your code, upload it, and AWS runs it for you **only when needed**.

ðŸ‘‰ **Key points (brief):**

* **Event-driven**: Lambda runs your code when something happens (e.g., file uploaded to S3, API Gateway request, DynamoDB change, CloudWatch event).
* **Pay-per-use**: You pay only for the execution time and resources used, not for idle servers.
* **Languages supported**: Python, Node.js, Java, Go, .NET, Ruby, etc.
* **Scales automatically**: If 1 user calls it or 1 million users call it, Lambda handles the scaling.
* **Stateless**: Each function run is independent, no saved state between runs (unless you use external storage like S3 or DynamoDB).

ðŸ‘‰ **Example**:
Imagine you upload a photo to an S3 bucket. A Lambda function can be triggered to automatically resize the image and save it back to another bucket.

Would you like me to also explain **how it is different from EC2** (so itâ€™s clearer)?
