Good question 👍 — this comes up **a lot** in AWS interviews. Let me explain clearly:

---

## 🔹 **What are VPC Endpoints?**

A **VPC Endpoint** lets your EC2 instances (or other resources inside a VPC) connect **privately** to **AWS services** (like S3, DynamoDB, Systems Manager, etc.) **without using the Internet, NAT Gateway, or IGW**.

So instead of traffic going:
`Private EC2 → NAT Gateway → Internet → S3`
it goes:
`Private EC2 → VPC Endpoint → S3 (inside AWS network)`

✅ This improves **security** (no Internet needed) and **reduces cost** (no NAT Gateway charges).

---

## 🔹 **Types of VPC Endpoints**

There are **3 main types**:

1. **Interface Endpoint (powered by AWS PrivateLink)**

   * Creates an **ENI (Elastic Network Interface)** in your subnet.
   * Used for most AWS services (SSM, KMS, CloudWatch, etc.) or even **your own custom services**.
   * Accessed via a **private IP** inside your VPC.

2. **Gateway Endpoint**

   * Works only for **Amazon S3** and **DynamoDB**.
   * You add it to a route table; traffic is routed internally to the service.
   * **No ENI created.**

3. **Gateway Load Balancer Endpoint (GLB Endpoint)**

   * Used for sending traffic to **third-party appliances** (e.g., firewalls, security services).
   * Typically used in advanced network security architectures.

---

## 🔹 **Example Use Case**

* You have a **private EC2** in a subnet without Internet access.
* It needs to download files from an **S3 bucket**.
* Instead of paying for NAT Gateway → You create a **VPC Gateway Endpoint for S3**.
* Now the EC2 can reach S3 **privately within AWS**.

---

## 🔹 **Interview Angle**

They usually ask:

* Why use a VPC Endpoint instead of NAT Gateway?
  ✅ Cheaper + more secure (no Internet exposure).

* Difference between **Gateway Endpoint** and **Interface Endpoint**?
  ✅ Gateway = S3/DynamoDB only, added in route table.
  ✅ Interface = works for most AWS services, creates ENI.

---

👉 In simple words:
**VPC Endpoint = Private doorway from your VPC to AWS services without going out to the Internet.**

---

Do you want me to also prepare a **step-by-step example** in AWS Console (say: private EC2 accessing S3 using VPC endpoint) so you can practice?

ENI
An ENI is a virtual network card that you can attach to an EC2 instance in a VPC.
It’s what gives your EC2 an IP address, MAC address, and network connectivity.

Think of it as the network adapter (LAN card) of your virtual machine in AWS.
