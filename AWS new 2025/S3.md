Got it 👍 Let’s go **briefly and clearly** about Amazon S3 and the terms you mentioned.

---

### **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**

* It’s an AWS storage service to store and retrieve files (called **objects**) inside **buckets**.
* Scalable, durable (99.999999999% durability), and secure.

---

### **Bucket Versioning**

* Keeps multiple versions of the same object.
* If enabled:

  * You can recover accidentally deleted or overwritten objects.
  * Every update creates a new version with unique **Version ID**.
* Disabled by default.

---

### **ACLs (Access Control Lists)**

* A legacy way to manage object and bucket permissions.
* Grants permissions to specific AWS accounts or groups (e.g., read/write access).
* Not recommended for new use cases (prefer **Bucket Policies & IAM**).

---

### **Access Points**

* Simplify access management to a bucket.
* Each access point has its own hostname and policies.
* Useful when multiple teams/apps need different permissions for the same bucket.

---

### **Block Public Access settings**

* Safety feature to prevent accidental public exposure.
* Can block:

  * Public ACLs
  * Public bucket policies
  * Cross-account access
* Recommended to **keep ON** for security.

---

### **Objects**

* The actual files you store in S3 (image, PDF, backup, etc.).
* Each object = **data + metadata + unique key**.
* Can be encrypted, versioned, tagged.

---

### **Tabs in S3 bucket console**

1. **Properties** – Settings for the bucket (versioning, encryption, lifecycle rules, replication).
2. **Permissions** – Who can access the bucket (IAM, policies, ACLs, Block Public Access).
3. **Metrics** – Usage stats (storage, request count, cost optimization, CloudWatch metrics).
4. **Management** – Advanced features (lifecycle rules, replication, analytics, inventory).
5. **Access Points** – Manage different access configurations for different apps/users.

---

👉 In short:

* **S3** = Store files.
* **Bucket Versioning** = Keeps history of files.
* **ACLs** = Old-style access control (not preferred).
* **Access Points** = Simplify controlled access.
* **Block Public Access** = Protect from accidental exposure.
* **Objects** = Actual files.
* **Properties/Permissions/Metrics/Management/Access Points tabs** = Bucket configuration options.

---

Do you want me to also give you **interview-style scenario questions** on these topics (like “how do you recover a deleted object if versioning is enabled/disabled”)?
Okay 👍 let’s go simple and brief:

### **Lifecycle Rules in S3**

* Lifecycle rules = automation for **object management** over time.
* You set **rules** to move or delete objects automatically, which helps save cost.

---

### **What You Can Do with Lifecycle Rules**

1. **Transition** – Move objects between storage classes:

   * Example: After 30 days → move from **S3 Standard** to **S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)**.
   * After 90 days → move to **S3 Glacier** for archival.

2. **Expiration** – Delete objects after a set time.

   * Example: Delete logs after 180 days.

3. **Versioned Buckets**

   * Expire old versions (delete non-current versions after X days).
   * Permanently delete expired delete markers.

---

👉 In short:
Lifecycle rules = **cost optimization + cleanup automation**.
They help you automatically **move, archive, or delete objects** based on age or version.

---

Do you want me to also draw a **real-time example scenario** (like log storage lifecycle from Standard → Glacier → deletion)?
Perfect 👍 let’s go **briefly but clear** on **Amazon S3 storage classes**.

---

### **What are Storage Classes?**

* In S3, every object is stored in a **storage class**.
* Each class is designed for **different cost, availability, and access patterns**.
* You choose based on how often you need the data and how long you want to keep it.

---

### **Main S3 Storage Classes**

1. **S3 Standard**

   * For frequently accessed data.
   * High durability & availability (99.99%).
   * Use case: websites, apps, active data.

2. **S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)**

   * Lower cost than Standard.
   * Good for data accessed occasionally but still needs fast access.
   * Example: backups, disaster recovery files.

3. **S3 One Zone-IA**

   * Like Standard-IA but stored in **one AZ only**.
   * Cheaper, but less resilient.
   * Example: secondary backups, data you can recreate.

4. **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**

   * Automatically moves objects between frequent and infrequent tiers.
   * Best when access patterns are unpredictable.

5. **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**

   * Very low cost.
   * Data available in **milliseconds**.
   * Example: archives that need occasional instant access.

6. **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (Formerly Glacier)**

   * Super low cost.
   * Retrieval takes **minutes to hours**.
   * Example: archives you rarely access.

7. **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**

   * Cheapest storage class.
   * Retrieval takes **12–48 hours**.
   * Example: compliance archives, data you must keep for years.

8. **S3 Reduced Redundancy (Legacy, not recommended)**

   * Lower durability, cheaper.
   * Mostly phased out.

---

👉 **In short:**

* **Standard** = frequent use.
* **Standard-IA / One Zone-IA** = rare access.
* **Intelligent-Tiering** = unpredictable access.
* **Glacier classes** = long-term archive (Instant, Flexible, Deep).

---

Do you want me to also make a **comparison table (cost, durability, retrieval time, use case)** so you can quickly revise before interviews?
Okay 👍 let’s make this line easy to understand:

---

### **“Control access to data sets within S3 by using identities from your corporate directory or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).”**

* This means you can decide **who can access your S3 data** (buckets, folders, or files).
* The “who” can be:

  * **Corporate directory users** → people in your company’s login system (like employees with office email IDs).
  * **IAM identities** → AWS users or roles you create in your AWS account.

---

### **“You can create only one Access Grants instance per AWS Region per account.”**

* An **Access Grants instance** is like the **main control room** in a region.
* You only get **one control room per AWS Region per account**.

  * Example: In `us-east-1`, you can only have **one Access Grants instance**.
  * If you also use `ap-south-1`, you can create **another one there**.

---

👉 In short:

* **Access Grants** let you manage who gets access to S3 data.
* You can use **company employees** (via directory) or **AWS IAM users/roles**.
* But you can only create **one Access Grants system per region per AWS account**.

---

Do you want me to also show you a **diagram-like analogy** (like office building with only one security office per city/region)?
S3 itself is global.

Buckets are region-specific (data lives in the region you select).

Bucket names are unique globally.
Perfect 👍 Here’s a **Quick S3 Interview Q\&A Cheat Sheet** you can use for last-minute revision 🚀

---

## 🔹 **Basic**

**Q1. What is Amazon S3?**
A: Object storage service to store/retrieve unlimited data, highly durable (11 9’s durability).

**Q2. Difference between S3 and EBS/EFS?**
A: S3 = object storage (files in buckets), EBS = block storage (for EC2), EFS = file storage (shared, NFS).

**Q3. Are S3 buckets global or regional?**
A: Buckets are **region-specific**, but bucket names are **globally unique**.

**Q4. What is an S3 object?**
A: A file stored in S3 (data + metadata + key).

---

## 🔹 **Storage Classes**

**Q5. Name S3 storage classes.**
A: Standard, Standard-IA, One Zone-IA, Intelligent-Tiering, Glacier Instant, Glacier Flexible, Glacier Deep Archive.

**Q6. Standard-IA vs One Zone-IA?**
A: Standard-IA = data in multiple AZs, One Zone-IA = stored in single AZ (cheaper, less durable).

**Q7. Intelligent-Tiering?**
A: Moves objects between frequent/infrequent tiers automatically based on access patterns.

**Q8. Glacier classes?**
A: Instant (ms retrieval), Flexible (minutes–hours), Deep Archive (12–48 hrs).

---

## 🔹 **Data Protection**

**Q9. What is versioning?**
A: Keeps multiple versions of objects to recover deleted/overwritten files.

**Q10. Recover deleted object if versioning enabled?**
A: Delete marker is created → restore by removing it or using the older version ID.

**Q11. What is Object Lock?**
A: WORM storage mode → prevents objects from being deleted/overwritten.

---

## 🔹 **Security & Access**

**Q12. ACL vs Bucket Policy vs IAM Policy?**
A: ACL = legacy object-level access, Bucket Policy = JSON rules at bucket level, IAM Policy = user/role access.

**Q13. What is Block Public Access?**
A: Feature to prevent accidental public exposure of buckets/objects.

**Q14. What are S3 Access Points?**
A: Named endpoints with their own policies for controlled access.

**Q15. What is S3 Access Grants?**
A: Scalable way to give access using IAM or corporate directory identities.

**Q16. Encryption types?**
A: SSE-S3 (AWS managed keys), SSE-KMS (KMS keys), SSE-C (customer keys), Client-side (app encrypts before upload).

---

## 🔹 **Performance & Optimization**

**Q17. What is lifecycle policy?**
A: Rules to transition data between storage classes or delete objects.

**Q18. Replication types?**
A: SRR (Same Region Replication), CRR (Cross Region Replication).

A: Generate a **pre-signed URL** with 24-hr expiry.

**Q26. Max object size in S3?**
A: 5 TB (multipart upload needed for >5 GB).

**Q27. Pre-signed URL vs Signed Cookie?**
A: Pre-signed URL = share single object securely, Signed Cookie = share multiple objects with one signature.

---

⚡ This sheet covers **30 core S3 questions** with crisp answers → perfect for quick prep.

Do you also want me to add **some tricky scenario-based questions** (the kind interviewers use to test real-world thinking)?
Great question 👍

### **What happens if you suspend versioning in S3?**

* **Old versions remain safe** ✅

  * Any object versions that already exist will stay in the bucket. They are **not deleted**.

* **New uploads don’t get version IDs** ❌

  * After suspension, when you upload a new object with the same key, it **overwrites the old object** (like normal buckets without versioning).
  * No new version is created.

* **Delete works normally** 🗑️

  * If you delete an object, it’s **permanently deleted** (no delete marker is added).

---

👉 **In short:**

* **Enable versioning** → every change/deletion creates a new version.
* **Suspend versioning** → bucket behaves like versioning was never enabled for new objects, but old versions are still there and retrievable.

---

✅ Example:

1. You enabled versioning → uploaded `file.txt` three times → you now have versions V1, V2, V3.
2. You **suspend versioning** → upload again → this overwrites V3 (no new version created).
3. V1, V2, V3 are still there, but no new versions will be added.

---

Do you want me to also explain the difference between **suspending versioning vs disabling it permanently** (trick interview question)?
Great one 👍 This comes up often in interviews.

---

### **MFA Delete in S3**

* **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) Delete** is a **security feature** in Amazon S3.
* When enabled on a **versioned bucket**, it requires an additional **MFA code** (from a physical/virtual device) to perform **sensitive delete operations**.

---

### **What does it protect?**

With **MFA Delete enabled**:

1. **Delete an object version** → needs MFA.
2. **Permanently delete a delete marker** → needs MFA.
3. **Suspend versioning** → needs MFA.

👉 Normal **PUT (upload)** and **GET (read)** operations don’t need MFA.

---

### **Why is it useful?**

* Prevents accidental or malicious deletion of data.
* Even if someone compromises your IAM credentials, they **cannot delete objects** without the MFA code.

---

### **Limitations**

* Works **only on versioned buckets**.
* Can only be enabled/disabled via **AWS CLI or API**, not from the AWS Management Console.
* Needs the **root account** to enable.

---

✅ **Example:**

* Bucket has versioning + MFA Delete enabled.
* If someone tries to permanently delete an object version, they must provide:

  * Normal AWS credentials **+**
  * MFA token code (e.g., from Google Authenticator).

---

👉 **In short:**
**MFA Delete = extra security step** that forces you to use a second factor (MFA code) before deleting or disabling versioned objects in S3.

---

Do you want me to also show you the **AWS CLI command** to enable MFA Delete (because that’s often an interview follow-up)?

explain me if my ec2 is in one AWS account and i need to access the s3 in another account for this to work what needs to be setup

Superb 👏 — this is one of the **most common real-world and interview questions** for AWS engineers (especially in DevOps roles).

Let’s break it down step-by-step in **simple language**, with **example setup** and **why each step matters**.

---

## 🎯 Scenario

You have:

* **Account A** → EC2 instance
* **Account B** → S3 bucket

You want your EC2 in **Account A** to access (read/write) data from the **S3 bucket in Account B**.

---

## 🧠 The Challenge

By default, AWS accounts are **isolated** —
EC2 in one account **cannot access** S3 in another unless **you explicitly allow it** using IAM policies.

So, we must **set up cross-account access** ✅

---

## 🏗️ What Needs to Be Setup

Here’s the **correct and secure way**:

---

### **Step 1: Identify resources**

| Resource  | Account   | Example                           |
| --------- | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| EC2       | Account A | EC2 with IAM role `EC2AccessRole` |
| S3 Bucket | Account B | `my-app-data-bucket`              |

---

### **Step 2: Create an IAM Role in Account A (for EC2)**

In **Account A**:

1. Go to **IAM → Roles → Create Role**
2. Choose **AWS service → EC2**
3. Attach an inline or managed policy that allows access to the target S3 bucket.

Example Policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-app-data-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-app-data-bucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

✅ This tells EC2 it’s *allowed* to access that S3 bucket — but the bucket also needs to **allow this access**.

---

### **Step 3: Attach Role to EC2 Instance**

Attach the role `EC2AccessRole` to your EC2 instance.

---

### **Step 4: Add Bucket Policy in Account B**

In **Account B → S3 → Bucket → Permissions → Bucket Policy**,
add a **cross-account policy** that allows the EC2 role from Account A to access it.

Example Policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowAccountAAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<AccountA_ID>:role/EC2AccessRole"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-app-data-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-app-data-bucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

✅ This gives permission from **Account B’s side** to allow **Account A’s IAM role**.

---

### **Step 5: Test Access from EC2**

Now on your EC2 instance (in Account A):

Run:

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://my-app-data-bucket --region <bucket-region>
```

If everything is set up correctly, you’ll see the bucket’s contents 🎉

---

## 🧩 How It Works

| Step                | Who controls it | What it does                                  |
| ------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| IAM Role Policy     | Account A       | Defines *what* EC2 is allowed to do           |
| Bucket Policy       | Account B       | Defines *who* is allowed to access the bucket |
| EC2 Role attachment | Account A       | Provides credentials for EC2                  |
| AWS internal auth   | AWS             | Validates trust between accounts              |

Both sides must **agree** (IAM + S3 bucket policy) — that’s what makes cross-account access secure 🔒

---

## 🧠 Bonus Tip: For Large Setups

You can simplify this using:

* **AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)** for shared resources
* **Cross-account IAM roles** (AssumeRole)
* **S3 Access Points** for fine-grained access control

---

## ⚡ Summary

| Component            | Configured In | Purpose                             |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| IAM Role (for EC2)   | Account A     | Gives EC2 permission to access S3   |
| Role attached to EC2 | Account A     | Provides temporary credentials      |
| S3 Bucket Policy     | Account B     | Grants Account A’s role access      |
| AWS Auth             | Both accounts | Validates cross-account permissions |

---

✅ **Final Access Flow:**

> EC2 (Account A) → IAM Role → Authenticated to AWS → Requests Object →
> S3 Bucket (Account B) checks policy → Grants access → File delivered 🎯

---

Would you like me to show the **same setup using AWS CLI commands** (creating role, policy, and bucket policy step-by-step)? That’s often how it’s done in DevOps pipelines.
------------------
presigned URLS what is this in S3
Excellent question 🌟 — this is a very **important S3 concept**, especially for **security and temporary access** in AWS.

Let’s break it down simply 👇

---

## 🔐 What is a **Pre-Signed URL** in Amazon S3?

A **pre-signed URL** is a **temporary, secure link** that gives **time-limited access** to a specific object (file) in your S3 bucket — **without making the object public**.

---

### 🧠 Simple Example

Let’s say:

* You have a **private S3 bucket** (no public access)
* You stored a file:

  ```
  s3://my-private-bucket/reports/data.xlsx
  ```

Now you want to share that file with someone — but **only for 10 minutes**.

👉 You generate a **pre-signed URL**.
That URL looks like this:

```
https://my-private-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/reports/data.xlsx?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=...
```

Whoever gets this link can download the file **without needing AWS credentials**, until it **expires**.

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

A **pre-signed URL** is generated using your AWS credentials and includes:

* File path (object key)
* Expiration time
* Signature (authentication token)

AWS validates this signature when someone tries to access it.

---

### 🧩 Use Cases

| Use Case                       | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧾 **Secure file download**    | Share a report, image, or document privately for limited time                                 |
| 📤 **Upload from browser/app** | Allow users to upload files directly to S3 without giving IAM access                          |
| 🧰 **Temporary API access**    | Backend service sends a pre-signed URL to front-end or mobile app for temporary S3 operations |

---

### 💻 Example Using AWS CLI

**Generate a pre-signed URL for a private file:**

```bash
aws s3 presign s3://my-private-bucket/reports/data.xlsx --expires-in 600
```

(`600` = 10 minutes)

Output:

```
https://my-private-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/reports/data.xlsx?X-Amz-Algorithm=...
```

✅ You can share this link, and it’ll work only for 10 minutes.

---

### 🧑‍💻 Example Using Python (boto3)

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

url = s3.generate_presigned_url(
    'get_object',
    Params={'Bucket': 'my-private-bucket', 'Key': 'reports/data.xlsx'},
    ExpiresIn=300  # 5 minutes
)

print(url)
```

---

### ⏰ Expiration

* Default: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
* You can set up to **7 days** maximum (when using AWS SDK)

After it expires, the link is invalid ❌

---

### ⚔️ Security Benefits

* Object remains **private** in S3
* Access is **temporary and controlled**
* No need to create a **public bucket** or **expose AWS credentials**
* You can audit link usage in **CloudTrail**

---

### 🧠 Summary Table

| Feature       | Description                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Access type   | Temporary (download or upload)                  |
| Bucket type   | Private                                         |
| Controlled by | Expiration time & signature                     |
| Max duration  | 7 days                                          |
| Use case      | Share files securely or upload from app/browser |

how can we create bucket in particular region
Perfect 👍 let’s learn how to **create an S3 bucket in a specific AWS region** — step by step.

You can do it in **three ways**:
1️⃣ via **AWS Management Console**
2️⃣ via **AWS CLI**
3️⃣ via **Terraform / IaC** (for automation)

Let’s see each one 👇

---

## 🧭 1. Using AWS Management Console (UI)

1. Go to **S3 → Create bucket**
2. Enter a **unique bucket name**, e.g. `my-app-bucket-2025`
3. Under **AWS Region**, choose your desired region
   👉 Example: `Asia Pacific (Mumbai) ap-south-1`
4. (Optional) Uncheck “Block all public access” if needed
5. Click **Create bucket**

✅ Your bucket will be created in **ap-south-1 (Mumbai)** region.

---

## 💻 2. Using AWS CLI

You can specify the region with the `--create-bucket-configuration` flag.

```bash
aws s3api create-bucket \
  --bucket my-app-bucket-2025 \
  --region ap-south-1 \
  --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=ap-south-1
```

✅ Bucket created in **Mumbai region** (`ap-south-1`).

> ⚠️ Note: The `--create-bucket-configuration` part is required for **all regions except `us-east-1`**.
> If you create in `us-east-1`, skip it:
>
> ```bash
> aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-app-bucket-2025 --region us-east-1
> ```

---

### ✅ Verify the Region

You can confirm the bucket’s region by running:

```bash
aws s3api get-bucket-location --bucket my-app-bucket-2025
```

Output example:

```json
{
    "LocationConstraint": "ap-south-1"
}
```

---

## ⚙️ 3. Using Terraform (Optional, Infrastructure as Code)

If you’re automating infrastructure:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-app-bucket-2025"
  region = "ap-south-1"
}
```

Then apply it:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

---

## 🧠 Summary

| Method    | Command / Steps                                         | Example Region |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Console   | Choose from dropdown                                    | ap-south-1     |
| CLI       | `--region ap-south-1` + `--create-bucket-configuration` | ✅              |
| Terraform | `region = "ap-south-1"`                                 | ✅              |

---

Would you like me to show you next how to **upload a file** into this region-specific bucket (both via console and CLI)? It’s usually the next step after bucket creation.

--------------
how many buckets can be created per region or even that is global
Excellent question again 👏 — you’re diving into one of those subtle but very **important S3 design details**.

Let’s clear this up step by step 👇

---

## 🧭 Bucket Limits — Global or Regional?

**✅ Bucket limits are global per AWS account, not per region.**

That means:

> The **total number of buckets** you can create is counted **across all regions combined**, not region by region.

---

### 💡 Default Limit

By default, each AWS account can create:

> **💰 100 buckets per account (globally).**

This means:

* You can have **100 total buckets**, no matter if they’re in:

  * `ap-south-1` (Mumbai)
  * `us-east-1` (Virginia)
  * `eu-west-1` (Ireland)
    … combined total ≤ **100**.

---

### 📦 Example

| Bucket Name       | Region     | Count |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| `app-data-mumbai` | ap-south-1 | 1     |
| `app-logs-us`     | us-east-1  | 1     |
| `media-files-eu`  | eu-west-1  | 1     |

✅ Total = 3 buckets → within 100 global limit.

You could mix regions freely — AWS counts total buckets globally.

### ⚙️ If You Need More

You can **request an increase** (up to 1,000 buckets) by creating a **Service Quota Increase request** in AWS Support.

Command (via AWS CLI):

```bash
aws support create-case \
  --service-code s3 \
  --category-code limit-increase \
  --issue-type service-limit-increase \
  --subject "Request to increase S3 bucket limit" \
  --communication-body "Need 500 buckets for multi-environment storage" \
  --region us-east-1
```

---

### 🧱 But… There’s a Better Practice

Instead of creating hundreds of buckets, AWS recommends:

> ✅ Use **folders (prefixes)** inside one bucket.

Because:

* There’s **no limit** on the number of **objects** per bucket.
* You can store **trillions of objects** in a single bucket.

Example:

```
my-app-bucket/
├── dev/
│   ├── file1.txt
│   └── file2.txt
├── prod/
│   ├── file1.txt
│   └── file2.txt
```

So you can logically separate data inside one bucket.

### 🧠 Summary

| Item                   | Scope                   | Limit                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Bucket count           | 🌍 Global (per account) | 100 (default), can be increased     |
| Buckets per region     | ❌ Not region-limited    | Same global count applies           |
| Objects per bucket     | ♾️ Unlimited            | Trillions of objects supported      |
| Bucket name uniqueness | 🌍 Global               | Must be unique across all AWS users |

---

### ⚡ Best Practice Tip

* Use fewer buckets.
* Organize with **prefixes** and **tags**.
* Use **IAM policies** or **S3 Access Points** for fine-grained permissions.

Here’s a **complete list of Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** interview questions — from **basic to advanced**, including **DevOps- and security-focused** scenarios relevant to your experience 👇

---

## 🧩 **Basic S3 Interview Questions**

1. **What is Amazon S3?**
   → Object storage service used to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time.

2. **What are S3 Buckets?**
   → Logical containers for objects; each bucket name is globally unique.

3. **What are S3 Objects?**
   → Files stored in buckets, consisting of **data + metadata + unique key**.

4. **What is an S3 key?**
   → The unique identifier for an object within a bucket (like a full path).

5. **What is the maximum object size in S3?**
   → 5 TB (but objects larger than 5 GB must use **multipart upload**).

6. **What is the durability and availability of S3 Standard?**
   → **Durability:** 99.999999999% (11 nines)
   **Availability:** 99.99%

7. **What is S3 storage class?**
   → Defines cost, durability, and retrieval time. Examples:

   * S3 Standard
   * S3 Intelligent-Tiering
   * S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)
   * S3 One Zone-IA
   * S3 Glacier / Glacier Deep Archive

---

## 🔐 **Security & Access Control**

8. **How do you secure access to an S3 bucket?**

   * IAM Policies
   * Bucket Policies
   * ACLs (Access Control Lists)
   * S3 Block Public Access settings

9. **Difference between IAM policy and Bucket policy?**

   * IAM policy → Attaches to users/roles.
   * Bucket policy → Attaches directly to the bucket and controls access to it.

10. **What are S3 Block Public Access settings?**
    → Global settings to prevent accidental public exposure of buckets.

11. **How can you encrypt data in S3?**

* **Server-Side Encryption (SSE):**

  * SSE-S3 (Managed by S3)
  * SSE-KMS (Managed by KMS)
  * SSE-C (Customer-provided key)
* **Client-Side Encryption**

12. **How can you restrict access to a specific IP range?**
    → Use **bucket policy** with `"Condition": {"IpAddress": {"aws:SourceIp": "IP_RANGE"}}`

13. **How do you enforce HTTPS access only?**
    → Bucket policy condition using `"aws:SecureTransport": "true"`

---

## 🧰 **Performance, Versioning & Lifecycle**

14. **What is Versioning in S3?**
    → Keeps multiple versions of an object to recover from accidental deletes or overwrites.

15. **What happens when versioning is suspended?**
    → New uploads get a `null` version ID; old versions remain.

16. **What is S3 Lifecycle Policy?**
    → Automates transitions between storage classes or deletion after a defined period.

17. **What is S3 Replication?**

    * **Cross-Region Replication (CRR)** → replicate objects to another region.
    * **Same-Region Replication (SRR)** → replicate within same region.

18. **Does S3 replication copy existing objects?**
    → No, only new or updated objects after replication is enabled.

19. **What is S3 Transfer Acceleration?**
    → Speeds up uploads using Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations.

20. **What is S3 Select and Glacier Select?**
    → Lets you query a subset of data using SQL-like syntax, improving performance.

---

## ⚙️ **Advanced & DevOps-Oriented Questions**

21. **How do you automate S3 bucket creation in CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Terraform)?**
    → Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or AWS CLI commands in pipelines.

22. **How do you monitor S3 usage and activity?**

    * AWS CloudWatch Metrics (for storage, requests)
    * AWS CloudTrail (for API activity)
    * S3 Access Logs

23. **How do you audit who accessed what in S3?**
    → Enable CloudTrail data events for S3.

24. **How do you handle accidental deletion?**

    * Enable Versioning
    * Use MFA Delete
    * Restrict `s3:DeleteObject` permissions

25. **How do you restrict users from deleting buckets?**
    → Deny `s3:DeleteBucket` in IAM policy.

26. **How can you make an S3 bucket act as a static website?**

    * Enable “Static Website Hosting” in S3 properties.
    * Provide index.html and error.html files.
    * Use Route 53 alias or CloudFront for custom domain and HTTPS.

27. **How do you restrict S3 access from only a VPC or EC2 instance?**
    → Use **VPC Endpoint Policies** and **bucket policy** with `"aws:SourceVpc"` condition.

28. **What are S3 Event Notifications?**
    → Automatically trigger Lambda, SNS, or SQS on events like `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.

29. **How do you integrate S3 with CloudFront?**
    → CloudFront acts as a CDN with S3 as the origin; improves performance and security.

30. **How do you handle cross-account S3 access?**

    * Bucket policy allowing other account’s IAM role/user
    * Or use AWS STS AssumeRole for temporary access
