Okay 🙂 Let’s make it very simple, like explaining to a 10-year-old:

---

👉 **What is API Gateway?**
Imagine you have a **big toy shop** with many different toys kept in separate rooms.
Now, when your friends come to play, they don’t know which room has which toy.

So, you put a **shopkeeper at the front gate**.

* If your friend asks, *“I want a car toy”*, the shopkeeper knows where to go inside and bring it.
* If another friend asks, *“I want a teddy”*, the shopkeeper again goes inside and brings it.

The **shopkeeper** here is the **API Gateway**.
It takes requests from people (your friends) and gives them the correct answer (the toy).

---

👉 **Usage in AWS:**
In AWS, API Gateway is like that **shopkeeper** who:

1. **Listens to people (users or apps)** when they ask for something.
2. **Finds the right service** (like Lambda, EC2, or database) to answer.
3. **Gives back the reply** in a nice way.
4. Also, makes sure only the **right friends with permission** can take the toys (security).

---

👉 **Why do we use it?**

* To **connect apps to AWS services** easily.
* To **control who can access** the services.
* To **protect your services** from too many requests.
* To **make apps faster** by caching (keeping ready answers).

---

✅ **Simple Example:**
Let’s say you made a **mobile app for school friends**.
They click a button that says “Show Today’s Homework.”
The app asks **API Gateway** → API Gateway goes to **Lambda function** → Lambda gets data from a **database** → API Gateway gives it back to the app.

So your friends see the homework without directly touching the database.

Perfect 👍 Let’s do a **Hello World** example in **AWS** with **API Gateway + Lambda**.
I’ll explain like a **story** so it’s easy to imagine.

---

## 🎯 Goal:

We want a **button (API link)**.
When someone clicks it → it should say **“Hello World”**.

---

## 🛠 Step-by-Step in AWS

### **Step 1: Create a Lambda Function**

* Go to **AWS Console → Lambda → Create Function**.
* Choose **Author from scratch**.
* Name it: `HelloWorldFunction`.
* Runtime: Python or Node.js (anything simple).
* In the code editor, paste:

**Python example:**

```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': "Hello World"
    }
```

* Click **Deploy**.
* Now your function is ready, but it doesn’t have a door for people to enter yet.

---

### **Step 2: Create an API Gateway**

* Go to **AWS Console → API Gateway → Create API**.
* Choose **HTTP API** (simpler than REST).
* Click **Build**.
* Name it: `HelloWorldAPI`.

---

### **Step 3: Connect API Gateway to Lambda**

* In API Gateway setup, choose **Add Integration** → Select your Lambda `HelloWorldFunction`.
* Create a route: `/hello` (this is like the “room name” for the toy).
* Method: **GET** (means just “ask” without sending data).
* Deploy the API → choose a stage name like `prod`.

---

### **Step 4: Get the URL**

* After deploying, you’ll see a URL like:
  `https://abcd1234.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/hello`

* If you open this link in browser → It will say:
  **Hello World** 🎉

---

### **Step 5: Test**

* Copy the URL and paste in browser → You get the message.
* Or use `curl` in terminal:

  ```bash
  curl https://abcd1234.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/hello
  ```

  It will return:

  ```
  Hello World
  ```

---

## ✅ What we did

* **Lambda** → the brain (gives answer).
* **API Gateway** → the shopkeeper (takes request, brings answer).
* **Result** → A public link anyone can use to see **“Hello World”**.

---

Would you like me to also explain how to **add security (API Key)** so only your friends with the secret key can use this “Hello World” API?
Great question 👍 Let’s break this down in **simple terms** first, then in **AWS terms**.

---

## 🎯 Simple Kid Example

Imagine you have a **secret playground**.

* Only your friends with a **special card (API Key)** can enter.
* You also tell them:

  * “You can only play **10 games per day**” → (Usage Plan = Limit).
  * “You can only play **from 9 AM to 5 PM**” → (Usage Plan = Rule).

👉 The **API Key** is like the **special card**.
👉 The **Usage Plan** is the **rules on how often they can use it**.

---

## 🛠 In AWS (Real Use)

* **API Key**: A secret string you give to apps/users so they can access your API.
* **Usage Plan**: Defines **limits & rules** for how that key can use the API.

  * Example: Max 100 requests per second.
  * Example: Max 10,000 requests per day.

---

## ❓ Is it Mandatory?

👉 **No.**

* If your API is **public** (like a "Hello World" demo), you don’t need API Keys or Usage Plans.
* If your API is **private / production** (like payment, personal data, company data), you **should** use API Key or other authentication methods (IAM, Cognito, JWT).

---

## ✅ When to Use

* **Learning / Testing** → Not needed.
* **Internal company apps** → Use IAM auth or Cognito (stronger).
* **If you sell APIs** (like weather data, stock prices) → Use API Keys + Usage Plans to limit usage.

---

👉 So, for your **Hello World API**, you can skip API Key & Usage Plan.
But if you want only your friends (with secret key) to use it → then enable API Key.

---

Do you want me to show you **how to add API Key & Usage Plan** in AWS API Gateway step by step?

Nice question 👏 Let’s go step by step so it’s super clear.

# 🌐 Types of API Gateway in AWS

AWS offers **3 types** of APIs you can create in **API Gateway**:

### 1. **HTTP API** (new, lightweight 🚀)

* Best for **simple APIs**.
* Fast, cheaper, and easy to set up.
* Supports Lambda, HTTP endpoints, and OIDC/JWT auth.
  ✅ Example: A mobile app calling Lambda to show "Hello World".

---

### 2. **REST API** (older, feature-rich ⚡)

* Full-featured API with more controls.
* Supports API Keys, Usage Plans, Request/Response validation, Caching, etc.
* More expensive than HTTP API.
  ✅ Example: Enterprise apps needing strict request/response handling.

---

### 3. **WebSocket API** (for live chats 💬)

* Used for **real-time 2-way communication**.
* Great for chat apps, stock tickers, IoT, multiplayer games.
  ✅ Example: A live cricket score app that pushes updates instantly.

---

# 🎯 Benefits of API Gateway

Why do people use it?

1. **Single Entry Point**

   * Acts as a "front door" for all your backend services (Lambda, EC2, databases).

2. **Security**

   * Add authentication (API Keys, Cognito, IAM).
   * Protects from unauthorized access.

3. **Traffic Control**

   * Usage Plans & Throttling → Prevents overload.

4. **Scalability**

   * Handles millions of requests automatically.

5. **Monitoring**

   * Works with **CloudWatch** for logs and metrics.

6. **Performance**

   * Can use **caching** to return faster results.

7. **Cost Efficiency**

   * Pay only for the requests you get.

---

# 💰 Pricing (as of 2025)

AWS API Gateway pricing is **pay-as-you-go**.

### **HTTP API (cheapest)**

* \$1.00 per **1 million requests**.
* Cheaper data transfer cost.

### **REST API**

* \$3.50 per **1 million requests** (more than HTTP API).
* Optional caching (extra cost, e.g., \$0.02 per GB-hour).

### **WebSocket API**

* \$1.00 per **1 million messages**.

⚡ Example:
If you have **5 million requests per month**:

* HTTP API → \$5
* REST API → \$17.5

---

# ✅ Summary Table

| Type              | Best For                   | Cost                | Features                             |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **HTTP API**      | Simple APIs, microservices | \$1 per 1M req      | Fast, cheap, fewer features          |
| **REST API**      | Enterprise, complex apps   | \$3.5 per 1M req    | Full features (keys, usage, caching) |
| **WebSocket API** | Real-time apps             | \$1 per 1M messages | 2-way live communication             |

---

👉 So, if you’re just **learning or testing**, go with **HTTP API** (simple + cheap).
👉 If your company needs **complex enterprise-level APIs**, use **REST API**.
👉 If you’re building **chat or live apps**, use **WebSocket API**.

---

Would you like me to also create a **real-world example comparison** (like building the same API in HTTP API vs REST API) so you can see the difference?
Perfect 👌 Let’s make this **super simple**.
In API Gateway (and in general Web APIs), we use **HTTP methods** — these are like actions you can do when talking to a server.

---

## 🎯 Imagine a School Library Example 📚

Your school has a library with books.

* You can **look at books**
* You can **add a new book**
* You can **update book info**
* You can **remove a book**

These actions are like API methods.

---

# 🌐 Common HTTP Methods

### 1. **GET** → 📖 Read something

* Just look, don’t change.
* Example: *Show me all books in the library*.
* API Example:

  ```
  GET /books
  ```

  → Returns a list of books.

---

### 2. **POST** → ➕ Add something

* Add new information.
* Example: *Add a new book to the library*.
* API Example:

  ```
  POST /books
  ```

  → Adds a new book with details (title, author).

---

### 3. **PUT** → ✏️ Update (replace)

* Update existing info (usually replace the whole record).
* Example: *Change the entire details of book #5*.
* API Example:

  ```
  PUT /books/5
  ```

  → Updates book #5 fully.

---

### 4. **PATCH** → 🩹 Update (partial)

* Update only part of the info.
* Example: *Just change the book title, keep author same*.
* API Example:

  ```
  PATCH /books/5
  ```

  → Updates only the title of book #5.

---

### 5. **DELETE** → ❌ Remove something

* Remove existing data.
* Example: *Remove book #5 from library*.
* API Example:

  ```
  DELETE /books/5
  ```

  → Deletes book #5.

---

# ✅ Quick Summary Table

| Method     | Action           | Example in Library |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| **GET**    | Read / Fetch     | Show me book list  |
| **POST**   | Create / Add     | Add new book       |
| **PUT**    | Update (full)    | Replace book info  |
| **PATCH**  | Update (partial) | Change only title  |
| **DELETE** | Remove           | Remove a book      |

---

# 🚀 In AWS API Gateway

When you create a route (like `/hello` or `/books`), you pick one of these **methods**:

* **GET** → return data from Lambda or backend
* **POST** → send data to Lambda/backend
* **PUT/PATCH** → update data
* **DELETE** → delete data

---

👉 Example in your **Hello World API**:

* If you used **GET /hello** → it just shows `"Hello World"`.
* If you used **POST /hello** with some data → it could save your name and say `"Hello Tejaaswini!"`.

---

Would you like me to show you a **working example in Lambda** that uses both **GET** and **POST** (one to show Hello World, one to take your name as input)?


My understanding: API gateway is like a shopkeeper where he knows where the items are and he route to that place and get the correct items to the people 

API Gateway hit the Lambda function and get the correct data from the backend without touching the DB and API gateway gives back to the app 

Not Mandatory these are optional
API keys - you are giving permission for the person with API key for the security purpose 
Usuage Plan - limit of sending the request of 1000 per day (rules basically)
