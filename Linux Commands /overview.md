## 🧠 **What Is the Linux Booting Process?**

The **booting process** is the series of steps your computer goes through from the moment you power it on until the Linux operating system is fully loaded and ready to use.

---

## 🪛 **Step-by-Step Linux Boot Process**

| Step | Stage | Description |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- |

### 1. **BIOS / UEFI**

* **BIOS** (Basic Input/Output System) or **UEFI** (newer version)
* Initializes **hardware** (keyboard, RAM, hard disk, etc.)
* Checks if all devices are working (POST – Power On Self Test)
* Looks for a **bootloader** in the configured boot device (e.g., HDD, USB).

---

### 2. **MBR / GPT (Disk Partitioning)**

* BIOS/UEFI looks at **MBR (Master Boot Record)** or **GPT (GUID Partition Table)** on the boot disk.
* MBR holds the location of the **bootloader** (like GRUB).
* GPT is modern and supports large disks and more partitions.

---

### 3. **Bootloader (e.g., GRUB)**

* GRUB = GRand Unified Bootloader
* Presents a **boot menu** (e.g., choose Ubuntu, recovery mode).
* Loads the **Linux Kernel** into memory.
* Passes **initrd/initramfs** and control to the kernel.

---

### 4. **Kernel Loading**

* The **Linux kernel** initializes the system:

  * Detects hardware
  * Mounts the **root filesystem** (`/`)
  * Loads drivers (network, storage, etc.)
* Switches from real mode to protected mode.
* Starts the **init system** (or `systemd`).

---

### 5. **init / systemd Process (PID 1)**

* This is the **first user-space process**.
* `systemd` is most common in modern Ubuntu systems.
* Reads config files from `/etc/systemd/`.
* Starts all services and daemons (network, SSH, GUI, etc.).

---

### 6. **Login Prompt (CLI or GUI)**

* Finally, you see the **login prompt** (on terminal or GUI login manager).
* After login, you’re taken to your shell or desktop environment.

---

## 🧠 **What Is the Linux Kernel?**

### 🔹 Definition:

* The **Linux kernel** is the **core** of the Linux OS.
* It sits between **hardware** and **software**.
* Think of it as a **bridge** that:

  * Manages CPU, memory, I/O devices
  * Schedules processes
  * Handles security and user permissions

### 🔹 Kernel Responsibilities:

* **Process Management** – Create/schedule/terminate processes.
* **Memory Management** – Allocate memory to applications.
* **Device Drivers** – Interface with USB, sound, network, etc.
* **System Calls** – Expose functions to userspace (e.g., `open()`, `read()`).

### 🔹 Types of Linux Kernel:

1. **Monolithic Kernel** – Linux is this type. All drivers and services run in kernel space.
2. **Modular Kernel** – Supports **loadable kernel modules** (can be loaded/unloaded without reboot).
3. **Microkernel** – Not Linux; minimal functionality in kernel space (like in Minix).

## 🔍 Example Files/Commands Related to Kernel

| File                           | Purpose                          |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `/boot/vmlinuz-*`              | Compressed Linux kernel image    |
| `/boot/initrd.img-*`           | Initial RAM disk (drivers, etc.) |
| `uname -r`                     | Show running kernel version      |
| `lsmod` / `modprobe` / `rmmod` | Manage kernel modules            |
