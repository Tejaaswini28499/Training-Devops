## 🧠 **What Is the Linux Booting Process?**

The **booting process** is the series of steps your computer goes through from the moment you power it on until the Linux operating system is fully loaded and ready to use.

---

## 🪛 **Step-by-Step Linux Boot Process**

| Step | Stage | Description |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- |

### 1. **BIOS / UEFI**

* **BIOS** (Basic Input/Output System) or **UEFI** (newer version)
* Initializes **hardware** (keyboard, RAM, hard disk, etc.)
* Checks if all devices are working (POST – Power On Self Test)
* Looks for a **bootloader** in the configured boot device (e.g., HDD, USB).

---

### 2. **MBR / GPT (Disk Partitioning)**

* BIOS/UEFI looks at **MBR (Master Boot Record)** or **GPT (GUID Partition Table)** on the boot disk.
* MBR holds the location of the **bootloader** (like GRUB).
* GPT is modern and supports large disks and more partitions.

---

### 3. **Bootloader (e.g., GRUB)**

* GRUB = GRand Unified Bootloader
* Presents a **boot menu** (e.g., choose Ubuntu, recovery mode).
* Loads the **Linux Kernel** into memory.
* Passes **initrd/initramfs** and control to the kernel.

---

### 4. **Kernel Loading**

* The **Linux kernel** initializes the system:

  * Detects hardware
  * Mounts the **root filesystem** (`/`)
  * Loads drivers (network, storage, etc.)
* Switches from real mode to protected mode.
* Starts the **init system** (or `systemd`).

---

### 5. **init / systemd Process (PID 1)**

* This is the **first user-space process**.
* `systemd` is most common in modern Ubuntu systems.
* Reads config files from `/etc/systemd/`.
* Starts all services and daemons (network, SSH, GUI, etc.).

---

### 6. **Login Prompt (CLI or GUI)**

* Finally, you see the **login prompt** (on terminal or GUI login manager).
* After login, you’re taken to your shell or desktop environment.

---

## 🧠 **What Is the Linux Kernel?**

### 🔹 Definition:

* The **Linux kernel** is the **core** of the Linux OS.
* It sits between **hardware** and **software**.
* Think of it as a **bridge** that:

  * Manages CPU, memory, I/O devices
  * Schedules processes
  * Handles security and user permissions

### 🔹 Kernel Responsibilities:

* **Process Management** – Create/schedule/terminate processes.
* **Memory Management** – Allocate memory to applications.
* **Device Drivers** – Interface with USB, sound, network, etc.
* **System Calls** – Expose functions to userspace (e.g., `open()`, `read()`).

### 🔹 Types of Linux Kernel:

1. **Monolithic Kernel** – Linux is this type. All drivers and services run in kernel space.
2. **Modular Kernel** – Supports **loadable kernel modules** (can be loaded/unloaded without reboot).
3. **Microkernel** – Not Linux; minimal functionality in kernel space (like in Minix).

## 🔍 Example Files/Commands Related to Kernel

| File                           | Purpose                          |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `/boot/vmlinuz-*`              | Compressed Linux kernel image    |
| `/boot/initrd.img-*`           | Initial RAM disk (drivers, etc.) |
| `uname -r`                     | Show running kernel version      |
| `lsmod` / `modprobe` / `rmmod` | Manage kernel modules            |

Great questions! Here's a clear explanation of each:

---

## 🧱 **1. What is the difference between `/bin` and `/usr/bin`?**

### 📁 `/bin` — **Essential system binaries**

* Contains **critical commands** needed for system **booting, repairing, and single-user mode**.
* Available even when only the **root partition (`/`) is mounted** (i.e., before `/usr` is available).
* Typical commands: `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `bash`, `mkdir`, `sh`, `cat`, `echo`.

### 📁 `/usr/bin` — **Non-essential user binaries**

* Contains **most user commands** that are not essential for basic boot or recovery.
* Usually mounted **after boot**.
* Contains: `python3`, `gcc`, `vim`, `firefox`, `nano`, etc.

### 🔍 Summary:

| `/bin`                   | `/usr/bin`                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Critical system binaries | Non-essential user applications |
| Available in early boot  | Mounted after root filesystem   |
| Minimal set of tools     | Full set of user programs       |

---

## ⚙️ **2. Where would you find configuration files?**

### 📁 `/etc` — The **main directory for configuration files**

* Contains **system-wide** config files for:

  * Users, networking, services, and applications.
* These files **should be text-editable** and not binary.

### 🔍 Examples:

| Config File            | Purpose                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `/etc/passwd`          | User account details    |
| `/etc/hostname`        | System hostname         |
| `/etc/resolv.conf`     | DNS configuration       |
| `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` | SSH server config       |
| `/etc/fstab`           | Disk mount info at boot |
| `/etc/systemd/`        | Service unit files      |

> 📌 User-specific configs go in hidden files in the user's home directory like `~/.bashrc`, `~/.gitconfig`.

---

## 🔐 **3. What does `/etc/shadow` contain?**

* `/etc/shadow` stores **hashed passwords** for all system users.
* It is readable **only by the root** user for security reasons.

### 🧬 Format of Each Line:

```bash
username:hashed_password:last_changed:min:max:warn:inactive:expire
```

### 🧾 Example Line:

```bash
tejaaswini:$6$rounds=656000$abc123...:19500:0:99999:7:::
```

### 🧠 Field Meaning:

| Field | Description                                                 |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Username                                                    |
| 2     | Hashed password (or `!` / `*` for locked accounts)          |
| 3     | Days since epoch when password was last changed             |
| 4     | Minimum days before password can be changed                 |
| 5     | Maximum days before password must be changed                |
| 6     | Warning period before password expires                      |
| 7     | Inactive period after expiration before account is disabled |
| 8     | Account expiration date (in days since epoch)               |

> 📌 Use `chage` command to view or change password aging info for users.
