Sure! Let’s break it **step by step**, so you can identify which directory is eating up your disk space.

---

### 1. **Check overall disk usage**

```bash
df -h
```

* `df` → shows disk space usage of all mounted filesystems
* `-h` → human-readable (GB, MB)

This tells you **which filesystem is almost full**, e.g., `/` or `/home`.

---

### 2. **Check usage per directory**

Use `du` (disk usage) to find which directories are large:

```bash
du -sh /path/to/check/*
```

* `-s` → summarize (total size per item)
* `-h` → human-readable

**Example:**

```bash
du -sh /home/*
```

Might output:

```
2.5G  /home/user1
10G   /home/user2
500M  /home/user3
```

✅ You can see that `/home/user2` is using the most space.

---

### 3. **Check nested directories**

If you want to drill down further:

```bash
du -h --max-depth=1 /home/user2 | sort -rh
```

* `--max-depth=1` → only show **top-level subdirectories**
* `sort -rh` → sort by size descending

This helps you **quickly identify which folder inside `user2` is huge**.

---

### 4. **Optional: Graphical view**

If you have `ncdu` installed (interactive CLI tool):

```bash
ncdu /home
```

* Shows a **navigable list of directories by size**
* You can explore and see which subdirectory is eating space

---

### ✅ Summary

1. Use `df -h` to see which **filesystem** is full.
2. Use `du -sh /*` or `du -sh /home/*` to find **top-level directories consuming space**.
3. Drill down with `du -h --max-depth=1` + `sort -rh` to find **subdirectories**.
4. Optional: `ncdu` for interactive exploration.

---

If you want, I can give you a **single command to show the top 10 directories consuming the most space on the entire system**, so you don’t have to drill manually. Do you want me to do that?
