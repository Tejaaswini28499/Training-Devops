you can make a user as a sudo user with 2 types.

1. by getting into the "visudo" file and changing as requried 

note: In MYAWS machine when open visudo file there is a group called wheel so if any 
user is added to that group he will become the sudo user.

2. sudo su - you will become the root user
cd /etc/sudoers.d - inside root etc and inside etc go tp sudoers directory
ls- you will find the list of file already exits.

ec2-user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL - this will be the content inside the file.
ALL= ALL permission 
NOPASSWD: it should not ask password while doing anything or while it 
ask password this step will be skipped 

note: always include sudo before the sudo user to become the root user
